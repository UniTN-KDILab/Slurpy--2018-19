        "To make the Whole-Wheat Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the two flours. Form a hole or nest in the flour and add eggs, oil and salt; stir to mix. Add a bit of flour or water, if needed, to form a dough. Separate the dough into two equal pieces and feed into the pasta maker to form a long, thin sheet of pasta dough. Or, flatten the dough with a rolling pin into a sheet, \u00bc-inch thick or less.<br />To make the Red Flag-\u00adStripe Dough: In a medium saucepan filled with cold water, boil beets over medium-\u00adhigh heat, about 5 minutes, or until soft. In a blender, combine the beets with \u00bc cup of the beet water, and blend into a puree. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours. Form a hole or nest in the flour and add beet puree, eggs, oil, salt; stir to mix. Add a bit of flour or water, if needed, to form a dough. Separate the dough into two equal pieces and feed into the pasta maker to form long, thin pasta strands, like spaghetti noodles. Or, flatten the dough with a rolling pin into a sheet, \u00bc-inch thick or less and use a knife to make skinny long strips. Lay the red dough strips on top of the sheets of whole-\u00adwheat dough, \u00bd-inch apart in a stripe pattern, and press into pasta. Lay it flat.<br />To make the Sauce: Toss all the sauce ingredients into a crockpot on low heat for 10 hours or more. Or, in a large stockpot, warm olive oil over medium heat, cook the garlic for 2 minutes, then add the remaining ingredients, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes until slightly thickened.<br />To make the Filling: In a large nonstick skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat, add the onions, garlic, and shrimp, and cook for 6 minutes or until the shrimp is pink and cooked through. Add the parsley and ricotta cheese and mix well. Salt to taste.<br />To Assemble: Place \u00bd tablespoon of filling on the overturned, flat dough sheet about \u00bd-\u00adinch apart. Brush beaten egg around the mounds of filling. Place the other flat sheet of dough on top of the mounds, so that the stripes are facing up. Press a very small cup, bowl, or cookie cutter around each mound of dough and filling to create a cut-out ravioli. Use the extra dough to make more raviolis. Seal the dough edges with a fork. In a large stockpot of boiling salted water, drop 10 ravioli in at a time, and cook over medium heat, for 6 minutes, or until they are completely cooked and float up to the top. On each plate, combine 5 ravioli with \u00bc cup of tomato sauce and serve.<br />",
