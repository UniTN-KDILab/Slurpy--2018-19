        "To make the Whole-Wheat Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the two flours. Form a hole or nest in the flour and add eggs, oil and salt; stir to mix. Add a bit of flour or water, if needed, to form a dough. Separate the dough into two equal pieces and feed into the pasta maker to form a long, thin sheet of pasta dough. Or, flatten the dough with a rolling pin into a sheet, \u00bc-inch thick or less.<br />To make the Red Flag-\u00adStripe Dough: In a medium saucepan filled with cold water, boil beets over medium-\u00adhigh heat, about 5 minutes, or until soft. In a blender, combine the beets with \u00bc cup of the beet water, and blend into a puree. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours. Form a hole or nest in the flour and add beet puree, eggs, oil, salt; stir to mix. Add a bit of flour or water, if needed, to form a dough. Separate the dough into two equal pieces and feed into the pasta maker to form long, thin pasta strands, like spaghetti noodles. Or, flatten the dough with a rolling pin into a sheet, \u00bc-inch thick or less and use a knife to make skinny long strips. Lay the red dough strips on top of the sheets of whole-\u00adwheat dough, \u00bd-inch apart in a stripe pattern, and press into pasta. Lay it flat.<br />To make the Sauce: Toss all the sauce ingredients into a crockpot on low heat for 10 hours or more. Or, in a large stockpot, warm olive oil over medium heat, cook the garlic for 2 minutes, then add the remaining ingredients, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes until slightly thickened.<br />To make the Filling: In a large nonstick skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat, add the onions, garlic, and shrimp, and cook for 6 minutes or until the shrimp is pink and cooked through. Add the parsley and ricotta cheese and mix well. Salt to taste.<br />To Assemble: Place \u00bd tablespoon of filling on the overturned, flat dough sheet about \u00bd-\u00adinch apart. Brush beaten egg around the mounds of filling. Place the other flat sheet of dough on top of the mounds, so that the stripes are facing up. Press a very small cup, bowl, or cookie cutter around each mound of dough and filling to create a cut-out ravioli. Use the extra dough to make more raviolis. Seal the dough edges with a fork. In a large stockpot of boiling salted water, drop 10 ravioli in at a time, and cook over medium heat, for 6 minutes, or until they are completely cooked and float up to the top. On each plate, combine 5 ravioli with \u00bc cup of tomato sauce and serve.<br />",

Set a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add a drizzle of oil and wipe it around with a paper towel to coat the bottom of the pan.4. Cook about 1/2 a cup of batter at a time, spreading it out with the back of a spoon if needed (it will be thick). Cook for a couple of minutes, until bubbles begin to break through the surface and the bottom is golden. Keep the heat to medium, as these will take longer to cook through that most pancakes, and you do not want to burn the bottoms.5. Flip with a thin spatula and cook until they are golden on the other side, and springy to the touch. Keep the pancakes warm on a rack set on a baking sheet in a 250\u00b0F oven while you finish cooking the rest.6. Serve drizzled with maple syrup (optional).<br />",

In a shallow dish combine the eggs, milk and Greek yogurt. Whisk until combined. Place breadcrumbs on another dish. Season the fish with salt and pepper, to taste. Lightly dunk the walleye into the egg mixture, draining any excess, and then place in the breadcrumbs, rolling and pressing to help the breadcrumbs adhere. Place the breaded fish onto the prepared baking pan. Bake for 12 minutes; turn on broiler, place under the broiler for 1 minute, then flip over and brown on the other side. (Or, leave in the oven for 5 more minutes.) Cut into small, bite-\u00ad\u2010\u2011sized pieces.<br />To make the Salsa: In a small bowl, combine salsa and Greek yogurt and blend until smooth.<br />To make the Tacos: In a large bowl, toss together cabbage, carrots and pineapple. On a plate, heat one tortilla in the microwave for 10 seconds or until warm and pliable. Top with \u00bc of the cabbage and carrot mixture and fish. Drizzle 2 teaspoons salsa on top, then top with a squirt of lime juice. Repeat with remaining tortillas, veggies, fish, salsa.<br />",

Roll each chunk into a very thin pancake, about 7-inches in diameter. Don't worry about making the dough into a perfect circle-just try to get it as thin as you can.<br />5. Heat a cast iron skillet (lightly greased) on medium-high heat. Place one chapati in the skillet and cook for 30 seconds.<br />6. Use a spatula to lift bread. When chapati gets brown spots and bubbles, flip it over and cook for another 30 seconds.<br />7. Wrap the cooked chapati in a cloth napkin while cooking the rest.<br />8.

In a large mixing bowl, combine chicken, breadcrumbs, cheese, parsley, seasoning, andgarlic. In a small bowl, beat the egg with salt and pepper until well blended. Pour the egg into the chicken mixture and mix with a large spoon until blended. Using a soup spoon or tablespoon as a guide, scoop out the chicken mixture and form balls, about 1\u00bd inches wide. Push two mozzarella cubes into the center of each ball and re-form the chicken over the cheese so they are covered and in a meatball shape. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden on bottom, then turn over and cook 10 more minutes. When cooked, stick three chicken cheese balls per skewer to serve over the Veggie Spaghetti.<br />To make the Veggie Spaghetti: Using a spiral veggie slicer, mandolin or box grater, shred zucchini and yellow squash into thin strips so it looks like spaghetti. In a large nonstick skillet, warm oil on medium heat. Add zucchini, squash, garlic, and carrots, and cook until tender but not mushy, about 5 minutes.<br />To Assemble: Divide the Veggie Spaghetti onto 6 plates and sprinkle with chopped basil on top of each plate. Place the Chicken Cheeseball Kabobs on top. Serve marinara sauce on the side, for dipping.<br />",

Cover, bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 2-3 hours.<br />3. With soap and water, carefully wash your hands and any counter surfaces and equipment that came in contact with raw chicken.<br />4. Remove cooked chicken pieces from broth with tongs or slotted spoon. Cool 10-15 minutes before separating bones from meat. Break meat into bite-size pieces. Remove any bones from broth.<br />5. Remove fat from broth by skimming with spoon, adding and removing ice cubes, or blotting top of broth with paper towels.<br />6. Put chicken meat, seasonings and vegetables into stock.<br />7. Bring broth to a boil, cover, reduce heat and cook about 15-20 minutes on medium heat until sliced carrots are crispy-tender.<br />8. Add noodles and boil uncovered for about 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up any noodles that might stick together. (One cup of dry noodles (1.5 ounce) makes one cup of cooked noodles).<br />9. Ladle into soup bowls.<br />10. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers within 2 hours of cooking. If refrigerated, use within 2 days. When reheating, bring to a boil.<br />",

Place into a dry dishcloth, squeeze and wring out any water into the sink. Pour out on a parchment-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 25 minutes, or until dry and lightly golden. Remove and cool. In a large mixing bowl, add cauliflower and remaining crust ingredients. Mix together until dough forms, then press mixture into two 8-inch circles on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil if desired. Turn oven up to 450\u00b0F and bake for 20 minutes.<br />To make the Sauce: In a large stockpot, combine all ingredients, stir, and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes.<br />To make the Sausage: In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the olive oil. In a large nonstick skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken mixture and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until cooked through and starting to brown.<br />To Assemble: To each crust, add 3 tablespoons sauce, any toppings, sausage, and \u00bc cup mozzarella cheese. Return to oven and bake 8 minutes, or until cheese is melted and toppings warm. Cut into 4 slices and enjoy.<br />",

Use a large spoon to remove the liquid fat from the pan. Discard the fat in the trash can.<br />Put the skillet back on the heat. Add water, macaroni, tomatoes, chili powder (if using), and seasoning mix to the skillet, and combine with the beef.<br />Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for approximately 20 minutes or until macaroni is tender.<br />Taste, and add a small amount of salt if desired.<br />Top with shredded cheddar cheese. Put the lid back on for 1 minute until the cheese is melted.<br />Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours. Eat within 3 to 5 days.<br />Be creative! Try using whole grain pasta. Add chopped vegetables such as green pepper or onion in step #3. <br />* This Eating Smart Seasoning Mix is used in two recipes in the Eating Smart \u2022 Being Active Let\u2019s Cook! Cookbook.

In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with the turkey, eggs, and basil and mix thoroughly. Roll into 1-inch meatballs and place on a baking sheet. Bake, turning the meatballs every 3-5 minutes to prevent them overly browning, for about 25 minutes.<br />To make the Lentil Soup Base: In a large saut\u00e9 pan,heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic,corn, carrots, celery, and tomatoes and cook for about20 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and the tomatoes are reduced.<br />Add the lentils and stir, then add the chicken broth,chili powder and cumin. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir one more time, then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 45 minutes,or until the lentils are tender. Season to taste withsalt and pepper.<br />Stir in the turkey meatballs, being careful not tobreak them when you stir. For the best-tasting soupand a little more thickness, let it simmer all together for an additional hour. Serve hot with mozzarella on top. Enjoy with a side of pita chips for dipping!<br />",

To keep the dough from sticking to the tortilla press, put a piece of plastic wrap (or a plastic bag) on the bottom surface of the press Put a ball of dough in the center of the plastic. Then place another piece of plastic wrap on the top of the dough. Press the dough flat in the press.<br />4. Pick up the tortilla with the plastic on both sides. Peel off one piece of plastic (which can be reused). Flip the tortilla off of the plastic onto a hot griddle. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom of the tortilla becomes golden.

Turn off the heat and leave the rice covered for 10 minutes. Fluff the rice and gently stir in the seasoned rice vinegar. Scoop rice into the rice mold, press down with the lid to pack it in, then gently push the rice out of the mold. (It helps to dunk the rice mold in a bowl of cold water in between pressings.) Repeat until you have pressed all the rice. If you do not have a rice press, you can mold the rice with your hands into little balls, dipping your fingers into cold water to keep rice from sticking. You should have about 20 balls or rice cakes.<br />2. To make the Crab Salad: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the crab meat with mayonnaise and a dash of wasabi and combine thoroughly.<br />3. To Assemble: Arrange the rice balls, crab salad, vegetable fillings, and seaweed on a serving platter. Now it\u2019s the fun part! Place one rice ball on a seaweed sheet, choose your fillings, wrap it up, and EAT! You can try different combinations on each roll. Serve with dipping sauces.<br />",

Immediately rinse under cold water to stop cooking and to make it easy to peel off shells. Refrigerate peeled eggs (without shells) until ready for use.<br />4. Slice eggs into halves lengthwise. Remove yellow yolks and save whites.<br />5. Place yolks in a one quart zip lock style bag along with the remaining ingredients (except the egg whites). Press out air.<br />6. Close bag and knead (mush together) until ingredients are well-blended. (Note: you could also put yolks in a bowl with other ingredients [except the egg whites], and mix together well until they look like a paste).<br />7. Push contents toward one corner of the bag. Cut about 1/2 inch off the corner of the bag. Squeezing the bag gently, fill reserved egg white hollows with the yolk mixture. (Note if you used a bowl, you can spoon the yolk mixture into the egg whites).<br />8. Chill to blend flavors.<br />",

        "To make the pot stickers: In a large saut\u00e9 pan heat the sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the chicken and cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, for about 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Squeeze out the excess water in the spinach then add to the pan. Add the flaxseed and egg and cook for another 5 minutes.<br />Place a tablespoon of the mixture on each pot sticker wrapper, fold in half, and seal the edges with water. Gently pleat the sides of the dough round to create a crescent shape.<br />In a nonstick frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Place a layer of pot stickers in the pan and cook, allowing the bottoms to crisp, for 3 minutes. Add \u00bd cup of water and steam for another 7 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pot stickers. Serve with a small dish of soy sauce for dipping.<br />To make the Kale Salad: Place the kale in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine the garlic and lemon juice. Gradually add the olive oil, whisking until combined. Drizzle the dressing on the kale, add the Parmesan cheese, season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Serve with the pot stickers.<br />To make the Sorbet: In a juicer or blender, process the \u00bd pineapple and the papaya (you will net about 2 cups of juice). Add the lemon juice and honey and blend. Add the mixture to an ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (or scoop into muffin tins, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 1 hour). Scoop out the soft mixture and freeze until firm, at least 1 hour. Serve a large scoop of sorbet in a papaya half. Garnish with quartered slices of pineapple.<br />",

(Note: you can also pierce whole potatoes with a knife or fork in several places and cook in microwave without water until fork tender, then cut each in half).<br />4. Meanwhile, in a skillet sprayed with non-stick cooking spray, combine cooked meat, broccoli, onion, carrots and water.<br />5. Boil until vegetables are fork tender - about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.<br />6. In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine milk, flour and pepper. Shake well.<br />7. Stir flour mixture into meat mixture until well blended.<br />8. Stir in cheese. Cook over low heat about 5 minutes longer or until sauce thickens, stirring frequently.<br />9. To serve, place 2 potato halves on each plate and mash the middle somewhat.

Let sit for 10 minutes to allow the remaining water and heat to steam the rice and cook it the rest of the way through.<br />Turn the warm rice out into a non-metal bowl. Drizzle the rice wine vinegar over the rice while gently stirring and folding the rice with a wide spoon. Continue stirring until the rice is no longer warm, about 10 minutes.<br />On your plastic-covered bamboo sushi mat, place one seaweed wrapper with the shiny surface facing down. Wet your hands and gently spread a thin, even layer of rice over the seaweed wrapper. Re-wet your hands as needed. Spread the rice to the edges of the mat.<br />On the nearest L of the wrapper, place a few matchsticks or slices of veggies and fruit horizontally across the rice. Make sure the ingredients reach both edges of the seaweed paper. Add a little cream cheese and shrimp or crab. Top with a few leaves of watercress.<br />Lift the bamboo mat with your thumbs, while gently keeping the filling in place with your fingers. Fold the wrapper over the filling and continue rolling in a jelly roll style. When the edge of bamboo mat has almost been rolled under the sushi, pull out that edge and continue rolling.<br />Unroll the bamboo mat and allow the sushi roll to sit for a few minutes before cutting. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make more sushi rolls. Cut each roll into 8 equal pieces with a wet knife.<br />",

        "To make the Tortillas: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. In a blender or a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until you get a texture finer than rice. In a steamer set in a large stockpot filled with boiling water, cook the riced cauliflower for 5 minutes. Let cool. Place the steamed cauliflower in a dishtowel or paper towel and squeeze out as much excess water as you can. Transfer the cauliflower to a large bowl. Add the eggs, garlic salt, onion, and pepper (you can use any spices you like).<br />Separate the mixture into 6 balls of equal size, and spread/smash each ball out on a parchment-lined baking sheet to make 6 small circles, each about the size of corn tortillas. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, then flip and cook for another 5 minutes. Set aside.<br />To make the Tostadas: In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat the black beans over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Mash the beans until they reach a refried bean consistency.<br />In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water to a boil. Stir in the brown rice and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, add \u00bd can diced tomatoes, and simmer for 5 minutes.<br />In a large nonstick saucepan, cook the turkey over medium-high heat, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, or until no pink is left. Add the remaining \u00bd can diced tomatoes and the red chile powder. Mix thoroughly, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.<br />Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, fry the eggs over medium heat.<br />To assemble: Layer each tortilla with 2 tablespoons mashed black beans, \u00bc cup rice, 2 tablespoons red chile\u2013turkey sauce, a pinch of cheese, 1 egg, avocado, tomato, onion, lettuce,1 tablespoon yogurt, and salsa!<br />",

Add broccoli to the skillet and cook for 10 minutes, or until internal temperature of diced chicken reaches 165 \u00b0F and broccoli is tender, but not mushy. (Note: Large broccoli pieces may be a choking hazard, for younger children, chop broccoli into smaller pieces.)<br />6. Prepare Sauce: In a small microwavable bowl, combine peanut butter, 2 tablespoons of warm water, soy sauce, cider vinegar, sugar, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes.<br />7. Microwave sauce for 30 seconds; remove from the microwave, whisk sauce and microwave for 30 more seconds, whisk again. (Note: Sauce will look stringy.)<br />8. In a small bowl, whisk remaining 1 tablespoon warm water with cornstarch to make aslurry (thin paste). Be sure cornstarch is fully dissolved in the water before adding the slurryit to the sauce.<br />9. Slowly whisk slurry into the peanut butter sauce until fully combined. Microwave 30 seconds or until thick. Whisk until sauce is a smooth-thick consistency.<br />10. In a large bowl, toss peanut sauce, chicken,broccoli, and noodles. Garnish each serving with 1 teaspoon of green onions, 1 teaspoon of cilantro, and one lime wedge (optional).

Use a spoon or your clean fingers to pluck a clump of the potato mixture from the bowl and spread it into a round, flat nest on the oiled baking sheet: it should make a circle that's about 3 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick.

Cut a small hole in each potato with a fork or sharp knife four times on each side, leaving about 1 inch between each hole. The holes allow steam to escape during baking; if you do not cut the potatoes, they may explode during baking.<br />4. If you want a softer skin, rub about a teaspoon of vegetable oil over each potato; for a crispy skin, do not use oil. (Wrapping the potato in foil will produce a soft skin not crispy.)<br />",

Dust a cutting board or clean countertop surface with flour. Put the ball of dough on the surface, then use your clean hands to knead the dough on the surface for about 5 minutes.<br />6. Spray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Put the dough in the bowl, and cover it with a clean dish towel. Put the bowl on the oven while it is preheating (but not on a burner that is turned on), and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes (preheating the oven will cause the stove top to be slightly warm and will help the dough rise).<br />7. Spray a 12 inch x 16 inch baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the dough into an even layer on the baking sheeet. Spread the dough into an even layer on the baking sheet. For a thicker crust, use a smaller baking sheet.<br />8. Add a thin layer of the Easy Marinara Sauce from the Eating Smart * Being Active Let's Cook! Cookbook, leaving a 1/2 inch crust on all edges.<br />9. Add the shredded cheese and pizza toppings. Be careful not to put too many toppings on the pizza, or it will be soggy.<br />10. Bake for approximately 15 minutes until the crust is brown and the cheese melts and is slightly browned in spots.<br />11. Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours. Eat within 3 to 5 days.<br /><br />",

To make the Quinoa Chickpea Salmon Rolls: In a large stockpot, bring the broth to a boil over medium heat, then add quinoa, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until tender.<br />2. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper, place salmon fillets skin side down, and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Bake for about 10 minutes, depending on thickness, or until it flakes easily with a fork.<br />3. In a medium mixing bowl, combine chickpeas, lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika, and mash until chunky. Add in quinoa and stir to combine.<br />4. To Assemble: On a nori sheet, spread \u00bc of the chickpea-\u00adquinoa mash, sprinkle with ponzu if using, then add cucumber and salmon pieces to the edge closest to you. Tightly roll nori sheet away from you. With warm water, moisten top edge like an envelope to seal the roll. (The rolling action can be done freestyle, or with the help of a bamboo rolling mat and clean dish towel.) Cut each maki roll into six pieces with a serrated knife.<br />5. To make Salad: In a large salad bowl, combine blueberry jam, oil, and vinegar and whisk. Add spinach and toss. Portion dressed spinach equally onto 4 plates and top with fresh blueberries and crumbled goat cheese.<br />",

Meanwhile, remove the excess water from the potato: you can either squeeze it by the handful, or put the entire pile on a clean tea towel and wring it out.3. Crack the egg in a medium bowl and beat it lightly. Add the potato, cooked lentils, garlic, green onion, and cheese and hot sauce if you're using them in a medium bowl. Add the salt and a good grinding of black pepper, and stir until combined.4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, then add a generous drizzle of oil (1-2 Tablespoons). Working in batches, so as not to crowd the pan, add clumps of the potato-lentil mixture (about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger works well), and flatten each as soon as it's in the pan, making them about a half inch thick.5. Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, until the latkes are deeply golden brown and cooked through. Add a little more oil to the pan for each additional batch. Serve immediately or keep the latkes warm in a 200\u00b0F oven for up to an hour.<br />",

When it\u2019s hot, sprinkle \u00bd teaspoon olive oil on each ear of corn, wrap in foil, place on the side of the grill, and cover. (You can also boil the corn; place in cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Drain and remove the kernels.) Cook for 10 minutes, turn the corn over; remove the chicken from the plastic bag and place onto the grill. Cook for 6 minutes on each side. Turn the grill off. Remove the chicken and corn, then unwrap the corn and place back on the grill for a few minutes to get grill marks. After corn has cooled, cut the kernels off the ears by holding cobs vertically and slicing downwards. Cut chicken into bite-\u00adsize pieces.<br />Meanwhile, cook quinoa according to package instructions in a large saucepan. In a food processor, add cauliflower and process until it\u2019s a rice-\u00ad like consistency.<br />In a large nonstick pan, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat, and then add the onions and garlic and cook for 3 minutes, or until softened.<br />Into the quinoa pan, add cauliflower, chicken, corn, onion, garlic, black beans, and cilantro. Warm over medium heat for about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and add Cotija cheese. Garnish with avocado slices, pumpkin seeds, and lime juice and serve!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",

Add the chicken and saut\u00e9, flipping, until cooked through and light brown.<br />To make the Noodles: Using a mandoline fitted with the appropriate blade attachment, slice the veggies into long thin strips. Season with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrots and saut\u00e9 for about 4 minutes, or until they start to soften. Add the remaining veggies and saut\u00e9 4 minutes more, or until they are all al dente.<br />To make the Bread: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Place the bread slices on a large baking sheet and brush lightly with the olive oil mixture. Toast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until golden.<br />To serve: Create a bed of noodles on each plate, top with chicken, and drizzle with sauce. Serve with the garlic bread.<br />",

Line a large bakingsheet with a piece of parchment paper, and place the doughon top. Place another piece of parchment paper on top androll the dough out with a rolling pin until it's a thin evencircular crust. Take off the top piece of parchment paperand bake the crust for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the sauceingredients in a small bowl.<br />Once the pizza crust is light brown, remove it from the oven and raise the oven temperature to 400\u00b0F. Remove the bottom piece of parchment paper, and place the crust back on the baking sheet. Evenly spread the sauce on the pizza crust, and put the diced red bell peppers on top of the sauce. Place the spinach on next and then sprinkle the cheese over the spinach. Finally, evenly place the zucchini on top of the pizza and drizzle some hot sauce on top if you like spicy food. Put the pizza back in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Remove from oven, and enjoy! I hope you liked the secret ingredient.<br />",

Stir until well blended.<br />3. Combine white and wheat flour in a separate bowl.<br />4. Stir in sugar, \u00bd teaspoon salt and 2\u00bd to 3 cups flour to make a soft, sticky dough. Turn dough onto well-floured surface.<br />5. To knead, fold dough in half and push dough flat with heels of hands. Turn dough 1/4 turn. Repeat for 5 to 7 minutes. If needed, add more flour until dough is smooth and elastic. Dough should not stick to hands or counter.<br />6. Cut dough into 12 even pieces (about golf-ball size).<br />To Form Pretzels:1. Roll one piece of dough into 15 inch long rope.<br />2. Cross left side over middle, creating loop.<br />3. Fold right side of rope up and over first loop to form pretzel shape.<br />To Bake:1. Place pretzels 3 inch apart on baking sheet. Enlarge holes in pretzels by inserting finger into holes. This will prevent them from closing during baking.<br />2. In small bowl, mix egg and 1 Tablespoon water together. Brush on pretzels. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.<br />3. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Best if eaten warm.<br />",

Pour the egg into a muffin cup. Repeat with the next three muffin cups. Place muffin pan in the oven for 4 minutes. Remove from the oven and add \u00bc of chicken, carrots, sprouts, cilantro, and tomatoes into each egg. Then place muffin pan back into oven and cook for another 15 minutes. Take out and let cool for 3 minutes; cover to keep warm.<br />2. To make French Toast Flowers: Meanwhile, mix the egg in a bowl with milk and cinnamon. In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter on low heat. Use a flower-shaped cookie cutter to cut 2 flower shapes out of each slice of bread. Dip and cover the bread flowers in the egg mixture. Add to the pan and cook for 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Transfer to plates. Add a halved cherry red tomato in the center of 2 of the French toast flowers and a blueberry in the center of the other 2 French toast flowers.<br />3. To make the Apple Bird\u2019s Nest: Cut the apple into spirals or cut around as if peeling to make the bird\u2019s nests out of the apple. It will make four small bird\u2019s nests. Top each bird\u2019s nest with blueberries. Serve 1 Egg Bird\u2019s Nest, 1 French Toast, and 1 Apple Bird\u2019s Nest on each plate.<br />",

Add the spinach, salt, and pepper to taste, and cook for 2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted but still bright green. Transfer to a plate.<br />To make the Omelettes: Break 2 eggs into a bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and whisk with a fork. In the same pan you cooked the veggies in, melt 1 teaspoon of butter over medium heat. Add the eggs to the pan and as they cook, continuously lift and swirl the pan so that the liquid portion of the eggs goes all the way around the edge of the pan to form a circle. Continue cooking about 30 seconds more, then flip using a spatula. You can either add \u00bd the veggie filling now and fold the eggs over, or do as we do, and cook 30 seconds on the second side, slide the omelets from pan onto a plate, and top with the filling. Make the second omelets with the remaining teaspoon butter and two eggs. Cut omelettes into four dog shapes using a large cookie cutter or use any type of cookie cutter. Top each with half of the filling if you didn\u2019t do the traditional fill-\u00adand-\u00adfold method.<br />To make Patriotic Parfaits: In two flat bowls, divide the honey and yogurt, and stir to combine. Fill a cookie cutter\u2014we used a dog shape\u2014with granola. Surround with strawberries, apple, and blueberries.<br />",

Meanwhile, in a large stockpot, bring the water and the rice to a boil on medium-\u00adhigh heat, about 4 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 40 minutes, or until tender and liquid has been absorbed.<br />3. In a large nonstick skillet, warm 3 teaspoons of olive oil over medium heat and add the pork. Cook until lightly browned, about 6 minutes, then add onions, garlic, apples, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cook another 6 minutes, or until onion is soft. Add the brown rice, mix well.<br />4. When squash is done, turn cut-\u00adside up in the baking dish. Add a teaspoon of olive oil to the center of each squash half and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the meat and rice mixture amongst the four squashes and fill the centers. Return to the oven for 10 minutes. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve. (If your squashes are big, you may want to cut into quarters to serve.)<br />",

In a food processor, add cauliflower and pulse until it becomes rice-like consistency. Place in a microwave-\u00adsafe bowl and microwave for 2 minutes, then stir and microwave again for another 2 minutes. Place in a thin dish towel, let cool for several minutes and then squeeze out as much liquid as possible. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add in cauliflower, cilantro, lime, salt, and pepper and mix until well combined. Use your hands to shape 4 \"tortillas\" on the parchment paper. Bake for 10 minutes, carefully flip each tortilla, and return to the oven for an additional 7 minutes, or until completely set and light golden. Place tortillas on a wire rack to cool slightly.<br />To make the Corn Salad: In a microwave-\u00adsafe bowl, cook the corn for 2 minutes. In a medium-\u00adsized mixing bowl, combine the corn with the remaining ingredients and set aside to marinate.<br />To make the Black Beans: In a large nonstick skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat, add the onions and salt, to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes, or until the onions have softened. Add the cumin and cook for about 30 seconds, add the beans and water. Stir, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Mash half of the beans with the back of a fork or a masher. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper to taste.<br />To Assemble: Place 2 tablespoons of the bean mixture into each cauliflower taco shell, top with corn salad, and enjoy with optional garnish.<br />",

In a large nonstick skillet, warm the oil over medium heat, and cook onions for 2 minutes, then add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add remaining ingredients and bring to a slow boil, about 4 minutes. Turn off heat and mash beans with back of wooden spoon or masher.<br />To make Tortilla Lasagna: In a round or square oven-\u00adsafe dish, put 2 tablespoons tomato sauce, followed by a tortilla, 3 tablespoons black bean filling, 1 tablespoon cheese, 5 spinach leaves, \u2155 of the corn, and bell pepper. Repeat with remaining tortillas and ingredients. (You will have a little tomato sauce, cheese, corn, and bell pepper remaining.)

Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Slice into wedges and garnish with any remaining peppers, corn, and cilantro.<br />",

Add the remaining ingredients and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.<br />3. To make the Secret Service Noodles: Spiralize the squash (or you can use a box grater) and put into a colander to drain excess juice. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and let stand for 15 minutes. Spiralize the carrots. In a large stockpot, bring 8 cups of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add squash, carrots, and asparagus. Cook for 3 minutes, drain into a colander and rinse the vegetables immediately with cold water.<br />4. In a nonstick skillet warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, squash, carrots, and asparagus, season with sea salt and pepper to taste, and cook for 1 minute.<br />5. To Assemble: Place serving of noodles on a plate and garnish with tomatoes, Parmesan, and parsley.
