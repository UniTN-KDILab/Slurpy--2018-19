Place the other flat sheet of dough on top of the mounds, so that the stripes are facing up. Press a very small cup, bowl, or cookie cutter around each mound of dough and filling to create a cut-out ravioli. Use the extra dough to make more raviolis. Seal the dough edges with a fork. In a large stockpot of boiling salted water, drop 10 ravioli in at a time, and cook over medium heat, for 6 minutes, or until they are completely cooked and float up to the top.

Applying Hoover's \u2018Food Will Win the War\u2019 approach to obesity, I vow to be part of the solution.\u201d Lola\u2019s Go Ride Your Bike dessert has cantaloupe, bananas, and other fruits.",

Falafel and mango salsa are a favorite in the Middle East, so this was an attempt to make a healthier version. Falafels are usually deep fried, whereas in this recipe they are baked and are just as delicious. The salsa includes tomatoes, which is Tennessee\u2019s state fruit. Tennessee is now home to a large Middle Eastern immigrant population, so there are many falafel places opening their doors in the state.\u201d",

Keep the heat to medium, as these will take longer to cook through that most pancakes, and you do not want to burn the bottoms.5. Flip with a thin spatula and cook until they are golden on the other side, and springy to the touch. Keep the pancakes warm on a rack set on a baking sheet in a 250\u00b0F oven while you finish cooking the rest.6. Serve drizzled with maple syrup (optional)."

Jamal found a way to significantly lower the sodium of his favorite dish by using the blue corn tortilla chips and because the dish is open, he adds even more vegetables and beans. Jamal already had a high blood pressure reading and we have a very strong family history of high blood pressure and diabetes on both sides. Jamal is very aware of the health concerns of his family and ethnicity. If he can make his food healthier, then he believes he'll live a more active life where he can keep doing all the fun things he loves to do.\u201d Jamal likes to serve this dish with a fruit salad.",

When you catch a lot of fish, you have to eat a lot of fish, so we come up with new ways to cook walleye. Since tacos are another favorite food, I thought it\u2019d be fun to make fish tacos. Fish is really healthy; my mom says it\u2019s got lots of protein and is low in fat. Lots of people batter and fry fish, but baking it is great. What\u2019s even better is that I can make it since my mom doesn\u2019t want me to get splattered by hot oil. Cooking is fun! I like to eat these tacos with fruit and milk.\u201d",

Lightly dunk the walleye into the egg mixture, draining any excess, and then place in the breadcrumbs, rolling and pressing to help the breadcrumbs adhere. Place the breaded fish onto the prepared baking pan. Bake for 12 minutes; turn on broiler, place under the broiler for 1 minute, then flip over and brown on the other side.

I put the meatballs on a stick, because I think it is fun to eat foods on a stick. I added carrots and yellow squash to make it colorful and taste even better. It looked like spaghetti, so I named it Veggie Spaghetti, and topped it with basil, which we grow. Everyone in my family loves it, even my brother, who is a picky eater. I hope you like it too!\u201d",

Push two mozzarella cubes into the center of each ball and re-form the chicken over the cheese so they are covered and in a meatball shape. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden on bottom, then turn over and cook 10 more minutes. When cooked, stick three chicken cheese balls per skewer to serve over the Veggie Spaghetti.",

Turn off the heat and leave the rice covered for 10 minutes. Fluff the rice and gently stir in the seasoned rice vinegar. Scoop rice into the rice mold, press down with the lid to pack it in, then gently push the rice out of the mold. (It helps to dunk the rice mold in a bowl of cold water in between pressings.) Repeat until you have pressed all the rice. If you do not have a rice press, you can mold the rice with your hands into little balls, dipping your fingers into cold water to keep rice from sticking. You should have about 20 balls or rice cakes.",

Many of the fruits and vegetables in my recipe are from my state, and some were even from my own garden. I substituted frying the cakes with baking as a healthier choice. The pickle sauce is like my mom's tartar sauce but healthier with yogurt. It tastes great now with all the healthy changes and I love it even more!\u201d Gianna always serves this with a fresh green salad.",

        "Grace's Supermeal: Cool Couscous and Berry Healthy Dessert",
        "\u201cThrough our cooking camps and Kids in the Kitchen class, I was inspired to eat well and make healthy food for my own family,\u201d says Grace. \u201cWe joined Grow Ohio Valley, a group that turns vacant city lots into gardens. Each week my mom and I would pick out our vegetables. It was great to know we were eating really fresh vegetables and helping our community. As a child I always liked when my mom made couscous and this past summer I found out how easy it was to prepare. Now I have a meal that even my picky 7 year-\u00adold sister will eat. The dish can be made in less than 20 minutes and is great packed up for lunch the next day.\"",

            "1. To make the Cool Couscous: In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a boil over medium-\u00adhigh heat. Stir in the couscous, cover, remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. In a nonstick skillet, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, asparagus, edamame, kale, peas, and green beans and cook about 6 minutes or until vegetables are tender and golden brown. Add tomatoes and stir to combine. Stir Greek yogurt into couscous, add vegetables, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add cooked chicken and stir to combine. Serve.",
            "2. To make Berry Healthy Dessert: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Grease an oven-\u00adsafe ceramic or glass baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Layer banana slices on bottom and then a layer of blueberries. In a small bowl, combine oats, walnuts, cinnamon and remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and using your fingers, crumble the butter into the mix thoroughly. Sprinkle on top of the blueberries, add a few additional berries, sprinkle sugar over the top and cook for 30 minutes, or until topping is golden."

        "\u201cI\u2019m involved with my local Dairy Council through a nutrition program at my school,\u201d says Reagan. \u201cI knew I had to incorporate dairy to make them proud, so I made a list of all of my favorite foods to see what kind of recipe I could come up with. I talked with a local chef at the university in my town and he explained what the new \u201csuper foods\u201d were and how important they are to our health. I then created a recipe that I thought would be great. I worked through trial and error until I finalized my recipe that is now delicious and includes my favorite and super foods.\u201d",

        "\u201cI created this dish because I like to cook with my mom in the kitchen,\u201d says Mena. \u201cI wanted to make a healthy meal that highlights my Korean background and also learn more about nutrition when I cook. I made this recipe for my dad and he loved the taste. I am very lucky to live in North Carolina because I can choose so many wonderful vegetables to cook with, including sweet potatoes, which are so tasty!\u201d Mena serves this with roasted sweet potatoes.",

            "To make the Korean Lentil Patties: In a large stockpot, combine lentils with the broth and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Once tender, drain the lentils to remove any extra liquid and let cool for 10 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the lentils with the remaining ingredients except the breadcrumbs. Form into 6 balls with your hands. Place breadcrumbs on a plate and roll the balls in the breadcrumbs, flatten into patties, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.Place the patties on a large baking sheet and drizzle olive oil over the top of the patties. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with Greek Dill Yogurt.",

The bubbles from the sparkling water also provide a fun new feeling for their mouth. Adults will enjoy this beverage too! ~Liz, CNPP Nutritionist",

My recipe includes ingredients we picked from our backyard like oregano and spinach. With my parents I learned to make a healthy pizza with a twist, one in which anyone can add the ingredients of their choice. I like the mix of flavors and the idea of me cooking it.

        "\u201cI'm a first generation-born American and proud to be born and raised in the great state of Oklahoma,\u201d says Maya. \u201cI wanted to create a recipe that represents my Pakistani heritage and my lovely state's homegrown products. My inspirations to cook healthy are my precious 14 year-old twin brothers who have cerebral palsy and also a severe seizure disorder. We found out that certain foods or even too many carbs or sugar can trigger seizures. I thought, wow, if we can help reduce their seizures just by what they eat, then I will definitely help prepare recipes for them. I had no idea that food played that big a part in our health. Ever since we decided to start eating healthy we noticed a huge decrease in their seizures and a bonus is I can focus much better at school.\u201d",

I was at a barbecue while on vacation and set my eyes on my first suckling pig,\u201d says Phoebe. \u201cThe sight convinced me to become a vegetarian. After studying with my parents about vegetarianism and how much protein my body needs, I decided that I would eat fish and chicken, but not mammals. Making this choice has forced us to find creative protein options. Fish is both high in protein and the good types of fats we need.\u201d",

It is a favorite Hawaiian dish and my family loves making and sharing poke at family gatherings. I named my dish Poke Me Ke Aloha (poke with love) because I put all the things I love in it. I serve the poke with quinoa because it is healthier than white rice.\u201d Kaira also serves guacamole and a banana-\u00adkale sorbet for dessert with this meal.",

Crack the egg in a medium bowl and beat it lightly. Add the potato, cooked lentils, garlic, green onion, and cheese and hot sauce if you're using them in a medium bowl. Add the salt and a good grinding of black pepper, and stir until combined.4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, then add a generous drizzle of oil (1-2 Tablespoons). Working in batches, so as not to crowd the pan, add clumps of the potato-lentil mixture (about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger works well), and flatten each as soon as it's in the pan, making them about a half inch thick.5. Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, until the latkes are deeply golden brown and cooked through. Add a little more oil to the pan for each additional batch. Serve immediately or keep the latkes warm in a 200\u00b0F oven for up to an hour."

        "\u201cI first tasted Kedgeree, a classic British dish with Indian roots, at a friend's house,\u201d says Lukas. \u201cWe couldn't find smoked haddock. My mom thought our local smoked salmon might work. I love kale, which grows like crazy in Washington, so we added it. Washington is also the perfect climate for mushrooms. We added crimini for their woodsy, creamy taste. Instead of the traditional English peas, we used asparagus. I think wonderful and tasty things can happen when cultures mix together. This Northwest take on a British-Indian dish was a hit with my picky 7-year-old sister. My mom was happy to get my little sister to eat more veggies and said the garlic and spices might strengthen our immune systems. I plan to serve this dish with wild blackberries when they are ready to be picked.\u201d",

Garnish with scallions, if desired. Enjoy!"

        "\u201cI first made this recipe with my great aunt Maria. My favorite part was pounding out the chicken, because it was fun and it made the chicken tender and juicy,\u201d says Josie. \u201cMy baby brother likes the carrot noodles best. I decided to use veggies for the noodles so the meal would be healthier. I would serve this meal with a glass of low-fat milk and a spinach salad to complete my plate.\u201d",

            "To make the Sauce: In a medium saut\u00e9 pan heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, basil, and oregano and saut\u00e9 for about 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Add 1 pound of the chopped tomatoes and the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, add the sun-dried tomatoes, salt, and pepper and cook about 20 minutes. About 10 minutes before serving, add the remaining tomatoes and cook until softened.",
            "To make the Chicken: One at a time, lay the chicken breasts between wax paper and pound out to \u00bc-inch thickness. On a plate, combine the brown rice flour, salt, and pepper. Lightly dredge the chicken in the flour mixture. In a nonstick saut\u00e9 pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and saut\u00e9, flipping, until cooked through and light brown.",
            "To make the Noodles: Using a mandoline fitted with the appropriate blade attachment, slice the veggies into long thin strips. Season with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrots and saut\u00e9 for about 4 minutes, or until they start to soften. Add the remaining veggies and saut\u00e9 4 minutes more, or until they are all al dente.",
            "To make the Bread: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Place the bread slices on a large baking sheet and brush lightly with the olive oil mixture. Toast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until golden.",
            "To serve: Create a bed of noodles on each plate, top with chicken, and drizzle with sauce. Serve with the garlic bread."

They turned out better than we expected, and were very easy to make as well. The peanut sauce was also an experiment that went the right way. Now we have spring rolls with peanut sauce all the time for lunch and dinner. Sometimes we have noodles on the side, along with a glass of milk.\u201d",

So, my dad and I work hard to create healthy, animal-shaped meals that Caitlin will eat\u2014she loves animals! When my mom told me about this contest, my first thought was making a healthy meal that Caitlin would love, which meant a breakfast-at-lunch theme in the shape of Bo and Sunny Obama. A lot of my ingredients are from Pennsylvania, including the eggs, mushrooms, and fruit. It\u2019s shaped like Portuguese Water Dogs because what kid doesn\u2019t like breakfast for lunch in the shape of adorable dogs?\"",

He also knew he wanted to use one of his favorite seasonings, smoked paprika. He thought about how his ingredients would go together, brainstormed ideas with his mom and grandma, and shopped for ideas and locally available ingredients that would go with the squash and pork.\u201d He serves his Squash with a Maple-\u00adGranola Yogurt Parfait on the side.",

(Cooking it whole makes it much easier and safer to cut in half.) Put squash, cut-side down, back on the baking sheet with \u00bc cup water, for another 20 minutes or until soft.",
            "2. Meanwhile, in a large stockpot, bring the water and the rice to a boil on medium-\u00adhigh heat, about 4 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 40 minutes, or until tender and liquid has been absorbed.",
            "3. In a large nonstick skillet, warm 3 teaspoons of olive oil over medium heat and add the pork. Cook until lightly browned, about 6 minutes, then add onions, garlic, apples, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cook another 6 minutes, or until onion is soft. Add the brown rice, mix well.",
            "4. When squash is done, turn cut-\u00adside up in the baking dish. Add a teaspoon of olive oil to the center of each squash half and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the meat and rice mixture amongst the four squashes and fill the centers. Return to the oven for 10 minutes. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve. (If your squashes are big, you may want to cut into quarters to serve.)"

That inspired me to whip up something that utilized vegetables for more than just the toppings. Cauliflower creates a twist on taco shells and is the foundation of a new take on tacos.

            "To make the Cauliflower Tortillas: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or grease with oil or nonstick cooking spray. In a food processor, add cauliflower and pulse until it becomes rice-like consistency. Place in a microwave-\u00adsafe bowl and microwave for 2 minutes, then stir and microwave again for another 2 minutes. Place in a thin dish towel, let cool for several minutes and then squeeze out as much liquid as possible. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add in cauliflower, cilantro, lime, salt, and pepper and mix until well combined. Use your hands to shape 4 \"tortillas\" on the parchment paper. Bake for 10 minutes, carefully flip each tortilla, and return to the oven for an additional 7 minutes, or until completely set and light golden. Place tortillas on a wire rack to cool slightly.",

        "\"I was inspired to make this dish because I love the beach!\" Abhijith says. \"I used mangoes, pineapple, and home-grown papaya to make it feel tropical. I wanted to keep the recipe simple and healthy, so I chose the quinoa, something my mom likes, especially since she is a cardiac patient. Lastly, I used fresh, local farm-raised catfish because you don't always have to be at the beach to feel like you're there!\" Abhijith likes to serve this dish with a Pineapple-Banana-Spinach Smoothie.",

While stationed at Langley Air Force Base, in Virginia, we visited the Yorktown Battlefield. That hot summer night we were in the mood for something light; this dish was originally made from local ingredients. The best part was brainstorming name ideas and laughing about all the ideas not chosen because they were too silly. Victory at Yorktown came up.

I discovered that chickpeas are really a super food and they are so tasty, too! In the summer, my brother and sister and I love to pick fresh vegetables from our backyard and we make different kinds of salads with them.
