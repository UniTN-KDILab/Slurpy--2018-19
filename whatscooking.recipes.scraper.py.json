            "1. To make the Spinach Filling: In a blender, combine water and cashew pieces. Blend on high for 1 minute until smooth. Pour into a medium bowl. Add tofu, salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, lemon juice, and spinach and mix well.",
            "2. To make the Calzones: Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. In a large mixing bowl, combine water and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add applesauce, honey, salt, and flour and stir well to combine. (You can also use a stand mixer or a food processor.) When dough forms a ball, knead it for 2 minutes on a work surface sprinkled with flour. Divide the bread dough into 6 equal pieces and roll into balls. Flatten dough with a rolling pin to 1/8-\u00adinch thickness. Divide the filling among the circles. Lift the edge and stretch the dough over to the opposite edge, enclosing filling, and pressing the edge of the dough gently to seal. Arrange calzones seam-side down on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.",
