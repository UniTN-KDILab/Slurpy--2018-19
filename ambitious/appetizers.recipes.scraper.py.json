            "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a fork to poke several holes all over sweet potatoes. Place on prepared baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour or until easily pierced with a fork. Allow sweet potatoes to cool for 10-15 minutes. Turn up heat in oven to 425 degrees F.While the sweet potatoes are cooling, make the honey-lime chipotle yogurt sauce: In a small bowl mix together the yogurt, honey, lime juice and chipotle chili powder. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more chili powder if you like things a little spicy. Place in fridge until ready to use.After sweet potatoes have cooled off, cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop out the inside flesh, leaving a thin layer flesh on sides and bottom of the sweet potato. Remember, it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t scoop it all out or you won\u2019t be able to fill the sweet potatoes up. You can use the leftover flesh for adding to smoothies or making muffins, pancakes or pie. Brush the inside and outsides of sweet potato with olive oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes to crisp up the outsides.Divide BUSH\u2019S\u00ae Chili Beans evenly between sweet potatoes. Sprinkle cheese on top. Bake for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Add a little of the yogurt sauce on top, then garnish with green onion, jalape\u00f1o slices and cilantro. Best if enjoyed immediately, but will stay good if properly covered in fridge for up to 5-7 days. Serves 6."

            "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a fork to poke several holes all over sweet potatoes. Place on prepared baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour or until easily pierced with a fork. Allow sweet potatoes to cool for 10-15 minutes. Turn up heat in oven to 425 degrees F.While the sweet potatoes are cooling, make the honey-lime chipotle yogurt sauce: In a small bowl mix together the yogurt, honey, lime juice and chipotle chili powder. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more chili powder if you like things a little spicy. Place in fridge until ready to use.After sweet potatoes have cooled off, cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop out the inside flesh, leaving a thin layer flesh on sides and bottom of the sweet potato. Remember, it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t scoop it all out or you won\u2019t be able to fill the sweet potatoes up. You can use the leftover flesh for adding to smoothies or making muffins, pancakes or pie. Brush the inside and outsides of sweet potato with olive oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes to crisp up the outsides.Divide BUSH\u2019S\u00ae Chili Beans evenly between sweet potatoes. Sprinkle cheese on top. Bake for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Add a little of the yogurt sauce on top, then garnish with green onion, jalape\u00f1o slices and cilantro. Best if enjoyed immediately, but will stay good if properly covered in fridge for up to 5-7 days. Serves 6."

Remember you only need about 5 ounces (or about 4-6 slices). Once done cooking bacon and it\u2019s crispy, transfer to a paper towel and pat away the grease as much as possible, then chop the bacon and set aside.Once the butternut squash and brussels are done roasting, transfer them to a large serving bowl and gently fold in chopped bacon, dried cranberries and toasted pecans.

Set the goat cheese on the counter to soften up a bit.On one baking sheet, toss the strawberries with the honey, then spread the strawberries into a single layer. Bake on the upper rack until the fruit is tender, juicy, and collapses on itself, 20 to 25 minutes, tossing halfway. Watch the fruit on the edges of the pan, as the honey can burn quickly.Meanwhile, on the remaining baking sheet, brush the olive oil lightly over both sides of each slice of bread. Bake on the middle rack until the toasts are golden on top, 10 to 12 minutes.Once the toasts are cool enough to safely handle, top each one with a smear of goat cheese, followed by a spoonful of roasted strawberries and their juices. Finish off the crostini with a sprinkling of torn basil and black pepper. Crostini are best served immediately."

Bake wedges for 20-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until tender and golden.While the potatoes are roasting, you can make the dressing: In a small bowl whisk together yogurt, dijon, honey and turmeric. Thin the dressing out with a few teaspoons of water so that you are able to drizzle it over the salad. Place in fridge until ready to use.Once the sweet potato wedges are done baking, remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Add fresh arugula on top, along with cherries and almonds, then drizzle with dressing and serve immediately. Serves 2 and makes a wonderful lunch or appetizer. Also great when served cold!"

            "First start by making the crust: In a large bowl of an electric mixer, mix almond milk, yeast, honey and olive oil together. Let it sit for a few minutes; you will know your yeast has activated if it begins to foam and bubble after a few minutes. If it doesn\u2019t start to foam or bubble, start over as this is critical to making good dough. After just a few minutes, mix in whole wheat pastry flour, cornmeal and salt with a wooden spoon. Place dough hook on mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. (If you don\u2019t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes.)Next place dough in a medium bowl lightly oiled with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let rise for 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. It\u2019s better if it\u2019s in a slightly warm place.While the dough is rising, you can make the caramelized onions: place olive oil a small saucepan over medium heat, add onion slices, spread the onions evenly out in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally. Check onions every 10-15 minutes until they have completely caramelized and turned golden in color. This usually takes 20-30 minutes total.After dough has doubled, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Add parchment paper to a large baking sheet, or grease with nonstick cooking spray.Grease 11x9 or 8x12 inch baking sheet generously with olive oil or nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with a little cornmeal. Dump dough into an oil rimmed baking sheet, and stretch dough out towards the edges. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for another 20 minutes. It\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t stretch all the way to the edges right way, it just needs a little time to rest.Make the balsamic reduction: Add balsamic vinegar to a small pot and place over low heat. Allow it to simmer for 10-15 minutes until reduced by half, then set aside until you are ready to enjoy on the pizza.After dough rests, pull again towards the edges of the pan so that it forms a nice small crust. Brush crust with a little olive oil. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until pizza is slightly golden brown on the crust and bottom.Brush dough or drizzle with just a little bit of olive oil, spread caramelized onions over the pizza, along with the figs and goat cheese. Bake for 5 more minutes or until onions and figs are warmed through.Remove pizza from oven and top with arugula and drizzle with balsamic reduction. Cut into 10-12 squares and enjoy!"

Roast for 10-12 minutes or until slightly golden.Allow nuts to cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a kitchen towel. Wrap nuts in towel and use your hands to roll the nuts around so that you remove the skins of the hazelnuts (don't worry about almonds). This helps to achieve a creamier nut butter. Keeping the skins on is okay though, just know your nut butter won't be as creamy.Once most of the skins are off the hazelnuts, you can transfer the nuts to the food processor or high speed blender (such as a Vitamix). Process on high until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Add coconut sugar & coconut oil to assist in blending. At this point the nuts should start to clump together. Continue to process until you reach the desired consistency. I like mine extra creamy!Once nut butter is blended, add in the spices and salt and blend for 30 seconds more. Pour into a large glass jar or container. To keep fresh, store in the fridge for up to 1 month. Not that it would last that long."

To do this cut the potatoes in half\u2026Place the cut potatoes into a large bowl and pat down with a paper towel to absorb any excess moisture. Next add olive oil, truffle oil, garlic, garlic powder and salt to the bowl, toss to combine. Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and gently toss again.Arrange fries on the two prepared baking sheets so that none of the fries are touching. This will allow them to crisp up while they bake. Spray the top of the french fries with a little olive oil cooking spray (canola also works). Place in oven, baking sheets side by side, and bake for 20 minutes, then flip fries over with a metal spatula and rotate the pans. Bake for 15-20 more minutes and flip again if necessary to brown all sides of the fries.Once fries are nice and golden brown, remove from the oven and allow to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes. Then drizzle a little extra truffle oil on top and garnish with extra parmesan, cilantro or parsley. Season with additional salt and pepper, if you\u2019d like! Serves with lots of ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce. Serves 4 people."

Let stand until yeast begins to foam, about 5 minutes. Add in toasted quinoa flour, flaxseed meal, salt, garlic powder, oregano and thyme; stirring to foam a large dough ball.Remove from bowl and place on a well-floured surface. Knead the dough for 5 minutes until it becomes smooth. You can also do this step in electric mixing bowl by using the hook attachment. Next coat a large bowl with olive oil and add dough, flipping once to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and wait for 30 minutes to an hour.Once ready to bake pizza: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a large baking sheet with olive oil.Roll out pizza dough into a large rectangle (about 14x7 inches) on a well-floured surface then place onto prepared pan. Bake pizza dough for 12 minutes. Remove from oven and prepare pizza: Spread pizza sauce over dough, sprinkle on onions, peppers and cheese then add olives, pepperoni and tomatoes on top. Bake for 8-10 more minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool for just a few minutes before cutting into 8 slices or squares. I usually enjoy 2 slices for a meal, but it works well as an appetizer too!"

Shake vigorously and massage so that the sweet potatoes are fully coated.Next evenly divide the rounds between the prepared baking sheets. Do not allow the rounds to touch. Bake for 15 minutes then rotate the pans and flip the chips. Bake another 10 minutes, rotate the pans again and flip once more. Repeat one more time (bake 10 minutes, flip chips). Once chips are browned and edges look a little crispy, they are done. They will crisp up more once they cool. Sprinkle with extra sea salt if desired. Makes 4 servings. Chips are best the day they are first made, as that's when they are the most crispy."

Turn heat on high until it begins to boil, then reduce to medium low, cover and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the sauce becomes thick. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. You may notice a popping sound; this is the cranberries bursting so don't worry!While the cranberries are cooking, you can cook the quiona: Add 1 cup of water and uncooked quinoa to a small saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and fluff quinoa with a fork; set aside to cool for a few minutes.To make the patties: In a large bowl, combine mashed butternut squash, quiona, onion, garlic, egg, cumin, parmesan, basil, salt and pepper. Form into 4 patties and place in the fridge for 10 minutes to help keep the patties in their shape. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and generously spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place patties in pan and cook for 4-6 minutes or until golden brown, then flip and cook 4-5 minutes longer or until they have nice crispy golden edges. They may be a little difficult to flip so be careful and make sure they are packed tightly.Serve warm with a few tablespoons of cranberry sauce over the top and extra basil, if desired. Makes 4 patties and a generous amount of sauce."

Bake according to directions on the package.While fries are baking, prepare the glaze: In a medium bowl whisk together marshmallow creme, greek yogurt, and salt together; set aside. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. The butter will begin to foam. Make sure you whisk consistently during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan; continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. Set aside to cool for a few minutes then whisk into the marshmallow creme until well combined.Once the fries are done baking, drizzle the brown butter marshmallow glaze over the fries. Alternatively you can also use the glaze as a dip since there will be a significant amount of it."
