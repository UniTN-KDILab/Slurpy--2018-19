Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top.

Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice. Preheat grill to medium-high. Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it\u2019s over indirect heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.\r",

            "          Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Double check that your tube pan is clean and dry. (Any trace amounts of oil could cause your whipped egg whites to deflate).\r",
            "          Stir flour, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and sugar substitute together in medium bowl and set aside.\r",
            "          In a large mixing bowl, whip the egg whites with the vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt together with mixer until medium-stiff peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar (3/4 cup) while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. When you think the egg whites have reached maximum volume, gradually fold in the flour mixture, one third at a time.\r",
            "          Stir in 1 cup fresh cranberries or 1/2 cup dried cranberries and orange zest. Be careful not to overmix.\r",
            "          Pour the batter in the prepared tube pan and bake 40-45 minutes or until cake springs back when touched. Balance the tube pan upside down on the top of a bottle to prevent decompression while cooling. When completely cool, run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert onto a serving plate.\r",
