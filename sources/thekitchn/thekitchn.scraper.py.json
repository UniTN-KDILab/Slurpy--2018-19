        "Recipe: Golden Beet and Barley Salad with Rainbow Chard",
        "<br> This colorful salad is an oldie but goodie, and a variation of another favorite of mine, my <br>Roasted Beet and Barley Salad<br>. I love the bright pops of golden beets and red onions mixed in with the barley and wilted chard stems. It\u2019s all tied together with a quick lemony dressing and topped with a sprinkle of salty feta. <br> Golden beets are sweeter and less earthy-tasting than the red beets with which most of us are familiar. They\u2019re great for getting reluctant beet-eaters hooked! You cook them just as you do for <br>red beets<br>, and as a bonus, they won\u2019t stain your hands purple. I love rainbow chard in this recipe (even more color!), but if your beets come with the greens still attached, you can substitute the beet greens for all or part of the chard. <br> I\u2019m also not going to lie: this recipe takes a little time to come together. With the beets baking, the barley simmering, and the chard cooking on the stovetop, there\u2019s a lot of multitasking going on. But on the flip side, you make <br>a lot<br> of salad. It\u2019s enough to feed a crowdor to keep in the fridge for quick lunches and dinners all week long. <br> This beet salad is a fantastic side for just about anything. On its own, I love it as a light lunch with a hunk of good sourdough bread. Either way you go, this salad is a winner. <br> I have to tell you that I love this salad just as much now as when I first made it over four years ago. Maybe more. There are so many good flavors and textures going on that I find myself going back to the bowl to serve myself one more scoop\u2026and then another. The lemon dressing really does bring it all together. You add a little lemon with the chard leaves and a little more in the dressing, so there\u2019s a pleasant tartness and freshness in every bite. It\u2019s just right. <br> This recipe is basically unchanged from when I wrote it. I re-arranged a few steps \u2014 it still takes some time in the kitchen to bring the salad together, but the process is a little more streamlined now. <br>\u2013<br>Emma<br> <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

        "<br> Here\u2019s one last recipe to squeeze into <br>your Thanksgiving line-up<br>! Tangy-sweet cranberry curd meets buttery walnut shortbread for a twist on the classic lemon bar. A dash of cinnamon ties it all together. And don\u2019t worry \u2013 this whole recipe can be made a day ahead, perfect for the busy Thanksgiving week. <br> I started out wanting to make this recipe with straight cranberry juice. I thought this would be an easier approach, plus then I could make the recipe at times of the year when fresh cranberries aren\u2019t available. <br> But sometimes it\u2019s hard to find cranberry juice. It turns out that most \u201c100%\u201d cranberry juices are actually a blend of cranberry, apple, and grape, which is then further diluted with water. In the end, it came down to buying a jug of organic \u201creal\u201d cranberry juice for $8 or making it from scratch from fresh cranberries for $1.50, and the fresh cranberries won hands down. <br> But the good news is that cooking fresh cranberries is far easier than you might think \u2013 or at least, it was easier than I had thought. You just combine about three cups of fresh berries with a half cup of water and let this simmer for about five minutes. The cranberries pop open and soften into a pur\u00e9e. (They do literally pop, so don\u2019t be startled!) Once strained of skins and seeds, this pur\u00e9e becomes the base for the curd in this recipe. <br> It\u2019s hard to keep from spooning the curd straight from the bowl. In fact, if you\u2019d like to use it as a spread on your morning toast, just cook it a little longer until it becomes jammy and wonderful. <br> <br>These vividly-hued cranberry curd bars are a delicious twist on sunny lemon bars. Take advantage of cranberries while they\u2019re available around Thanksgiving and give these a go. The nutty press-in crust is sturdy enough to hold up to the sweet-tart cranberry curd, and these bars are a great after-dinner treat or or afternoon pick-me-up with a steaming mug of coffee or tea. If you\u2019re not a fan of walnuts, I\u2019ve also made these with almonds with great success. <br> I made these in both metal and glass pans, which both worked fine. How long the cranberry curd takes to cook on the stovetop can vary quite a bit, so just stir constantly and take it off the heat as soon as it comes to a simmer. Don\u2019t worry about any little lumps in the curd \u2014 they\u2019ll get strained out before going onto the crust. <br> \u2013 <br>Christine<br>, November 2018<br> <br> <br>Related:<br> <br>Thanksgiving Sides: 5 Alternatives to Cranberry Relish<br> <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

            "Remove the pan from the heat, add the butter all at once, and stir until completely melted. Pour the curd through the strainer again into a clean bowl to strain out any small chunks of cooked egg. Pour the warm cranberry curd onto the crust and spread into an even layer.",
            "Bake until the curd is set but still jiggles slightly in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Place the pan on a wire rack and cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate until chilled through, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.",
            "When ready to serve, run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cranberry bar slab. Use the parchment paper as handles to lift the slab from the pan onto a cutting board. Trim off the sides to make even edges if desired. Cut into 24 pieces. Dust the tops of the bars with powdered sugar, which will melt into the cranberry curd and make a sweet glaze. Garnish each square with the candied citrus zest if desired."

        "How To Quickly Cook Shrimp on the Stovetop",
        "<br> Here\u2019s the thing about shrimp: They are <br>so easy <br>to make. The effort-to-reward ratio is high with this particular seafood. Even pulled straight from the freezer, I can have a platter of quick-saut\u00e9ed shrimp on the table in 15 minutes flat. Add a bowl of garlicky pasta or a leafy green salad, and dinner is a done deal. <br> I usually buy bags of frozen shrimp and keep them stashed in my freezer for quick meals. Look for shrimp that has already been peeled and deveined, as this makes life much easier. I prefer shrimp with tails left on for appearance\u2019s sake (plus the tails can make a great shellfish stock), but it\u2019s totally fine to buy them with tails already removed if you prefer. <br> One thing to note: Most shrimp has already been frozen once, and even the \u201cfresh\u201d shrimp sold at most seafood counters has usually been frozen and thawed. There\u2019s nothing wrong with buying thawed shrimp from the counter, but you should cook it within a day or two and it\u2019s best not to re-freeze it. <br> You can also buy shrimp of any size you find or have a particular hankering for. The technique below calls for medium (17 to 21 count) shrimp, but the method is the same for smaller or larger shrimp. The cooking time will be quicker for smaller shrimp and a bit longer for larger shrimp. <br> Most shrimp are a good choice from a sustainable seafood perspective \u2014 especially U.S. wild-caught or U.S. farmed shrimp. For more information and buying guides for specific shrimp, take a look a the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s factsheet. <br> <br>Shrimp Factsheet<br> from the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Seafood Watch<br> <br> Even larger shrimp will cook in just a few minutes on the stovetop. With shrimp, it\u2019s incredibly easy to know exactly when they\u2019re done \u2014 yet another thing I like about them. They start off translucent, grey, and a bit flabby, and they\u2019re done when they\u2019ve turned completely opaque with a pearly pink color and bright-red tails. One minute they\u2019re a bit odd-looking and unappealing, and the next minute it\u2019s hard to keep from eating them directly from the pan. There\u2019s absolutely no guesswork involved. <br> While I could probably be perfectly happy with a bowl of shrimp and nothing else, most of the time shrimp needs some accompaniment to make it a meal. Shrimp is used in almost every world cuisine, from Italian scampi to Thai noodle dishes. Take your cue from them \u2014 serve shrimp over pasta or rice noodles, with a bowl of sticky rice, over a bed of greens, or with some roasted vegetables on the side. <br> What\u2019s your favorite way to have shrimp for dinner? <br> Serve your saut\u00e9ed shrimp with \u2014 or over! \u2014 any of these dishes to make a complete meal.

        "Recipe: Apple Pie Stuffed French Toast",
        "<br> During the winter holidays, I make plenty of pies so that everyone feels comfortable taking a big slab, but that also means I have some leftovers. Transforming apple pie leftovers into a stuffed French toast isn\u2019t difficult at all. Crush up the filling and crust, stuff it into a generous slice of brioche or challah, give it a quick pan-fry, and bake it to finish. Not too shabby, eh? <br> To make this stuffed French toast, you need to get a long loaf of soft, enriched bread like <br>challah<br> or <br>brioche<br>, cut it half, lengthwise, and start stuffing. The goal here is to get the egg mixture to seep into the bread without the bread falling apart. <br> The bread has to be thick enough on each side and on the bottom to support the weight of apple pie filling. You will be trimming the ends off a loaf to make it seven or eight inches long. It\u2019s then cut lengthwise into two thick, very long pieces. These two slabs of bread then get a pocket cut into them that you stuff with the pie. All this definitely means you can\u2019t use bread that has been pre-sliced. <br> The good news is that this French toast can be made with one- or two-day old bread. I buy or make a second loaf when making my holiday stuffing and label it \u201chands off,\u201d so no one eats it before I get to it for breakfast. <br> This is a versatile dish; it works with any leftover fruit pie or nut tart. To be honest, though, this recipe has another purpose for me. I serve stuffed French toasts through the holiday season when (some of) my college-aged kids are home, with plenty of fresh fruit and piping-hot coffee or tea, so we can all sit down and eat together, knowing that everyone will leave with a full tummy and a smile, and I get to share another moment of savoring that holiday pie, with all of us together.

        "How To Make a Foolproof Quiche",
        "<br> If you haven\u2019t had quiche lately, it is time to remedy that situation. I could eat quiche for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever growing tired of it, but quiche is an especially good dish for a big brunch or other casual gathering. You make it the day ahead, slice it just before serving, and then pass out the plates. This foolproof recipe has yet to disappoint. <br> Quiche is essentially a custard made with milk and eggs poured into a pie crust and baked. You want just enough eggs to set the milk, but not so many that the quiche becomes rubbery. You want a bit of wobble in your quiche as it comes out of the oven. Wobble means silky, melt-away custard in every bite. <br> The foolproof part comes courtesy of the French. They are masters of the quiche and long-ago settled on the perfect formula of one part egg to two parts liquid dairy. A standard large egg weighs two ounces and a cup of milk is eight ounces, so a good rule of thumb is two eggs per cup of milk. I like to bump this up a bit to make a more substantial quiche and usually go with three eggs and a cup-and-a-half of milk and cream in a nine-inch pie crust. <br> <br>Memorize this ratio for perfect quiche custard<br>: One part egg to two parts liquid dairy. <br> The seemingly tedious task of blind baking, that is partially baking the crust before filling, prevents the quiche crust from getting soggy while baking, but also ensures that the crust and the custard are perfectly done at the same time. <br> <br>Read more here: <br>How To Blind Bake a Pie Crust<br> <br> Cheese makes a luscious custard even more luscious. There\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule here. Two cups of cheese makes an especially rich quiche, good for a family brunch or dinner party. Cut it back to a cup or so for a weeknight dinner. <br> The other fillings just need to be cooked through and fairly dry. Aim for one to two cups cooked ingredients \u2014 fewer lets you enjoy the silkiness of the quiche, while more make a more substantial meal. Wilted spinach, crisp bacon bits, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, caramelized onions, and asparagus are all favorites in various combinations. <br> I\u2019m always surprised by how easily a quiche comes together. I\u2019m still working on my pie-crust skills, but luckily, this is maybe the one dish where the crust is secondary to the filling. That first bite of soft, eggy custard makes all other thoughts fade away. <br> What is your favorite quiche? ",

        "How To Make Pumpkin Cheesecake",
        "<br> Pumpkin cheesecake has become a fall and winter dessert classic for good reason. The lively, familiar spices of classic pumpkin pie are balanced by the cool and creamy goodness of a New York-style cheesecake. <br> The combination makes each bite memorably delicious and worthy of any celebration \u2014 especially Thanksgiving. <br> Even if you have never made a cheesecake or pumpkin pie before, this is a dessert that is within your reach. This recipe was designed to work for the novice baker and the seasoned cook. <br> There are a few built-in techniques that make this cheesecake successful, and a few ingredients that ensure a great result every time. <br> Below are a few of the key elements that ensure success. <br> If you only make one cheesecake this year (and let\u2019s be honest, most of us aren\u2019t making more than that), let it be this luscious pumpkin number. Don\u2019t let the lengthy-looking recipe deter you \u2014 it comes together surprisingly easily (the hardest part is waiting to eat it). And the results are well worth it: an irresistibly creamy and fluffy cheesecake with a crisp, buttery graham cracker crust. <br> To quicken the process and cut down the ingredient list, I swapped in pumpkin pie spice for the individual spices. If you prefer the original recipe, use 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg in place of the pumpkin pie spice. <br> <br> \u2014 <br>Grace<br>, October 2018 <br> ",

        "How To Make Stuffed Roast Squash",
        "<br> With so many <br>beautiful and unusual squashes<br> showing up in markets right now, I can\u2019t seem to come home without at least one knobby, colorful, speckled new squash in my bag. Happily, stuffed squash is a dish that will work for just about any winter squash I happen to pick up. You don\u2019t really need a recipe \u2014 just a few basic steps and dinner practically makes itself. <br> I consider stuffed squash to be one of the most perfect autumn weekend meals imaginable. I love futzing over the filling and then lazing on the couch while everything roasts. The house gradually fills with savory aromas until I can hardly wait another second to dive in. <br> Eating these stuffed squashes is an entirely personal experience. My husband likes to work from the outside in, taking a little bit of squash and a little bit of filling in each bite. I\u2019m a masher, personally \u2014 I scrape all the squash from the sides and mix it thoroughly into the filling before finally digging in. You can take either approach, or invent your own special style! <br> One squash the size of a grapefruit or a little larger is usually enough for two people. All my instructions below are written with this in mind, but it\u2019s easy enough to multiply everything to feed more people. In fact, stuffed squash is an easy and elegant dish to serve at a dinner party, particularly since it can be easily adapted to for both <br>vegetarians and non-vegetarians<br>. <br> I\u2019ve tried making stuffed squash with just about every squash out there, and I truly love them all. Acorn squashes are an old and dependable favorite, but try it also with red kuri squashes, sweet dumpling squashes, or even spaghetti squashes. The initial roasting time of the un-stuffed squash may vary depending on the variety, but it rarely takes more than an hour. <br> For the squashes today, I used a mix of barley, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and mozzarella seasoned with thyme and a pinch of cinnamon for the filling. Fall flavors at their best! I often use whatever bits of leftovers are in the fridge, mixing that last scoop of quinoa, a bit of roasted chicken, some grilled vegetables\u2026 whatever needs using. About two to three cups of combined ingredients will do the job just fine. <br> Do you often make stuffed squash?

        "How To Make Gravy Without Turkey Drippings",
        "<br> For some folks, the ideal Thanksgiving gravy is built on pan drippings from a roasted turkey. But there are times when the pan drippings need to go into other dishes, or the drippings are too salty for gravy, or we just need to make our Thanksgiving gravy before the big day and reheat it before eating. You might need a vegetarian gravy to satisfy all of your guests, or maybe you just need extra gravy for eating up Thanksgiving leftovers. This gravy is a basic recipe you can make anytime, built from a flavorful mix of onions, a simple roux, and broth seasoned with fresh herbs. <br> Since traditional gravies are built on the back of flavorful drippings made by roasting meat slowly in the oven for hours, the intricate taste of roasted drippings are hard to replicate. Instead of roasting more meat or frying bacon to cheat our way to pan drippings, caramelize an onion slowly over medium heat. Let the onions cook long enough to create a deeply brown sticky base of flavor in the pan \u2014 this is what professional cooks know as <br>fond<br>. When the broth is added to the gravy, use your spoon or spatula to scrape these tasty bits off the bottom of the pan. <br> Roux isn\u2019t a new kitchen concept for anyone who has made gravy before. A mixture of flour and fat, roux thickens gravy by releasing the starchy power of all-purpose flour. Roux can be a thick paste kneaded together before cooking gravy, or it can be a thin slurry added to already-cooking liquid. You can also make a roux as you\u2019re cooking by sprinkling a pan that already has fat in it (butter, oil, bacon fat, doesn\u2019t matter which) and then cooking the flour slightly before adding the gravy liquid. For gravy without drippings, building a pan roux is another way to add roasted flavor. Let the flour brown a bit, adding even more caramelization to the onions, their fond, and the final gravy. <br> <br>Learn more about roux: <br>Building Blocks: How To Make a Roux<br> <br> This gravy makes a smaller portion than most because it\u2019s built to be fully customizable for every guest at the table. Make a small boat for each of the following friends and become the most revered host of all. <br> This gravy freezes incredibly well. Yes, you can cool and freeze this gravy before the holidays. Just thaw the frozen gravy in the fridge overnight before reheating the gravy slowly over low heat. Whisk the gravy regularly to avoid separation as it reheats. ",

        "How To Make Red Wine Sangria",
        "<br> We here at The Kitchn are firm believers in the power of sangria. Pull a pitcher from the fridge as guests arrive and no one needs much encouragement to start pouring glasses. It feels fancy and instantly festive, but sangria is also one of the easiest big-batch cocktails you can make. As the party host, it\u2019s a no-brainer. <br> We\u2019ve shared a lot of fun recipes for sangria over the years, from a <br>sparkling peach sangria<br> to a <br>strawberry & limoncello ros\u00e9 sangria<br>, but today we\u2019re all about keeping it classic. Here\u2019s how to make the perfect red wine sangria for your next summer gathering. <br> The primary qualification for the wine going into your sangria? That it\u2019s cheap! Any red wine that you enjoy drinking is a good candidate, and it shouldn\u2019t be expensive. Here we use an inexpensive Rioja from Spain, but you could also use Malbec or Merlot for a sweeter result. <br> Most sangria recipes call for the wine to rest overnight, or at the very least, for a few hours in the refrigerator. This lets the fruit infuse the wine, letting its juices get in the mix and sweeten up the drink. In our opinion, the sweetness in sangria should come from the fruit itself, and perhaps the wine, but not soda like 7-Up. (If you like your sangria to be sweeter, try substituting tonic water for the soda water.) <br> You won\u2019t get this lovely, fruity sweetness unless the sangria has a period to rest in the fridge. If you taste the sangria just after mixing it, you\u2019ll probably think it tastes harsh or unbalanced. After a night in the fridge, it will taste mellow and juicy. Sangria gets better and better as it sits. ",

        "<br> Mashed potatoes are a family favorite, but this decadent casserole takes the classic to a whole new level. The flavors of a fully loaded baked potato are baked until gooey and bubbling, making this dish impossible to resist. It\u2019s holiday-worthy for sure, but don\u2019t wait for a special occasion. Add this comfort food to your list of fall favorites \u2014 and oh yeah, don\u2019t forget to share! <br> A hazard of being a recipe developer is working ahead of the calendar, so I\u2019ve probably been in fall cooking mode a bit longer than most. Thankfully this weekend will bring a drop in temperatures that will finally match the food I have been craving. What can I say other than bring on the braises, hot cocoa, and anything in a casserole dish! <br> This decadent side is my new cold weather go-to \u2014 it\u2019s hearty comfort food in creamy, cheesy form. I\u2019ve already brought it to a steak dinner and a Southern tailgate, both times to rave reviews. And since I\u2019ve been getting plenty of recipe requests I figured it was time that I share. <br> One of the things I love about this casserole is how it can take many different forms. I\u2019ve done variations with both hash browns and mashed potatoes, but I think smashed just might be my favorite \u2014 the chunky potatoes provide a welcome textural contrast to the sour cream and cheese. I\u2019ve also tried both baking the potatoes and boiling them, and really you can do whichever method you like best. Sub Greek yogurt for a bit of tang or dress it up with silky cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. In the end it\u2019s hard to mess this one up! <br> I promise this casserole will be gobbled up and have your family begging for more. After a long summer of salads and fresh veggies, go ahead and indulge. <br> This casserole is such a smart recipe to have in your back pocket. It\u2019s all the great things about mashed potatoes, made even better with extra cheese and a crispy lid. I love how make-ahead-friendly it is, which means it\u2019s the perfect choice for Thanksgiving and other festive occasions throughout the colder months. I\u2019ve increased the amount of milk from the original recipe to ensure the potatoes are nice and creamy and bumped up the Parmesan cheese so the top gets extra golden \u2014 two things I don\u2019t think anyone will complain about. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, October 2018<br> ",

Here\u2019s how I make my absolute favorite, foolproof dinner rolls, a perfect addition to any table. <br> These are dinner rolls that you can trust. They are soft and tender, but with enough substance to them that they won\u2019t break apart under the butter knife. They have a mild sweetness that goes equally well with a Sunday chicken dinner or a casual potluck brunch. <br> You can make these rolls from start to finish in the span of a few hours, and they are excellent fresh from the oven. All those recipes that tell you to wait until the bread is cool before eating? Don\u2019t listen to them here. For mid-week meals, freeze a batch and warm them up for a few minutes in the oven before serving. <br> Very astute observers will note that this recipe is nearly identical to our recipe for <br>Hamburger Buns<br>. That\u2019s because I love the dough from that recipe so much that I use it any time I want a tender, soft bread to go with our meals. (Heck, the recipe is also pretty close to my favorite <br>Sandwich Bread<br> recipe, too!) For these dinner rolls, I just divide the dough into more pieces to make smaller buns and bake them in a casserole dish to help them reach puffy perfection \u2014 and also because the tear-away edges make me nostalgic for my grandmother\u2019s rolls. <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the home? <br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> <br> <br>(Images: Emma Christensen)<br> ",

        "<br> Every time we make vegetable stock, we wonder why we ever bother buying it in the store. It\u2019s so <br>easy<br>! Chop up some vegetables, cover with water, and simmer. Done. You\u2019ll have enough stock to make your soups, casseroles, and pilafs for weeks to come, and all in just a little over an hour. <br> When making a basic vegetable stock, you want vegetables with neutral, but savory flavors. Some recipes recommend adding garlic and other strong spices, but unless we know how we\u2019re going to be using the broth, we prefer to add those kinds of seasonings when we\u2019re actually making a dish. We also don\u2019t add salt to the stock for the same reason. Onions, carrots, celery and mushrooms are the ideal starter vegetables for stock, but feel free to swap any of these for leeks, tomatoes or parsnips. <br> We keep a big resealable bag in our freezer where we <br>can throw vegetable odds and ends<br>: vegetables that have wilted beyond saving, the green parts from leeks, trimmings from carrots, and so on. Once this bag gets full, we use the contents to make broth. <br> Seems contrary to the title but not every vegetables is destined for vegetable stock. Starchy vegetables like potatoes and turnips will make for a gummy, cloudy vegetable stock. Beets overpower their aromatic counterparts. Zucchini and greens beans become bitter when slowly simmered for as long it takes to make this stock. <br> While vegetable broth is a basic building block of the kitchen it doesn\u2019t have to be boring. Consider adding leftover Parmesan rinds to your vegetable stock. <br>Kombu<br> is powerful addition, mostly for its thickening and umami abilities. <br> Two ways to add more flavor to your broth are to roast the vegetables beforehand or to let them sweat (start to soften and release their liquids) for a few minutes over the heat before adding the water. <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

Cranberries are high in pectin, so a quick simmer with water and sugar is all you need for a basic sauce. This recipe doesn\u2019t include the fancy fixings some people add like walnuts or coconut. I\u2019ll leave that up to you. If only the turkey would be this easy! <br> I did add a couple of optional flavorings; some may prefer to leave these out. If you want some spice, simmer with a cinnamon stick or a couple cardamom pods. <br> What are your favorite ways to flavor basic cranberry sauce? ",

        "How To Cook Green Beans",
        "<br> For perfectly cooked green beans that are flavorful, crisp, and tender, you have to employ a quick two-step technique. Here\u2019s how to do it. <br> Snap, string, or green beans are all names for pole or bush beans that grow in the spring and early fall. You\u2019ll find pole and bush beans in green, yellow, and purple hues. Haricots verts are a smaller, thinner French varietal that can also be cooked using this method if you reduce the cooking time in half. Buy fresh green beans for this method (not frozen or canned, which are each partially cooked). Be sure to rinse the green beans and remove the stem end before cooking. <br> Saut\u00e9ing the green beans first achieves two things. First, it quickly removes some moisture from the beans, concentrating their flavor while also improving their snap. Saut\u00e9ing also heats the pan so the water added during the second step quickly turns into the steam that cooks the green beans all the way through. <br> Adding a small amount of water to the hot pan of green beans creates steam that can be captured with the lid and used to gently finish cooking the beans. Steaming green beans is better than boiling because it prevents the beans from overcooking and preserves a vibrant green color. <br> While the recipe below calls for olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes to season the beans, you can easily swap those ingredients to customize the beans\u2019 flavor. Use sesame oil, ginger, and Chinese five spice instead, or simply swap the olive oil for butter (it will brown and become nutty) and add slivered almonds instead of red pepper flakes at the end. Once you\u2019ve mastered the basic technique, go ahead and mix things up. ",

        "How To Make Gluten-Free Gravy",
        "<br> This recipe makes a classic gravy that\u2019s perfect for gluten-free holiday tables. Unlike many gluten-free gravy recipes that rely on starch as the thickener, this one is thickened with sweet rice flour, giving you a rich and flavorful gravy that no one would guess is gluten-free. <br> This gravy has three major components: flour, fat, and stock. The stock and fat aren\u2019t different from traditional gravy recipes \u2014 although we\u2019re sharing some best practices on those two elements here \u2014 the major difference is in the flour used to create the gluten-free roux that thickens the gravy. <br> Some traditional gravies are thickened with roux \u2014 a mixture of equal parts fat and flour. This gravy follows that tradition and uses a<br> <br>gluten-free roux to that same effect. Sweet rice flour is my go-to flour for making gluten-free gravy. It contains a slightly higher starch content than other gluten-free flours, making it silky and smooth. Even more, because this flour is gluten-free, it doesn\u2019t clump as easily as wheat flour. No more lumpy gravy on Thanksgiving! <br> To prevent the gravy from tasting of raw flour, cook the roux for about three minutes, or until it turns a light golden-brown. Over the years, I\u2019ve found that if I cook a sweet rice flour roux to a dark, caramel color, the gravy tastes burnt. So I recommend stopping as soon as the roux turns a very light brown. This, in turn, creates a blonde gravy \u2014 but don\u2019t mistake this for lacking in flavor. It\u2019ll be just as satisfying when you pour it over mashed potatoes and turkey. <br> <br>Sweet rice flour substitute: <br>If you can\u2019t find sweet rice flour, replace it with an equal amount of white rice flour. <br> Most roux-based gravies start with butter, but the most flavorful gravy is built from turkey fat. While a turkey roasts, fat \u2014 along with pan juices and meaty bits \u2014 collects in the bottom of the roasting pan. You can use this fat to make a rich, flavorful gravy. The drawback? You must wait until after you\u2019ve roasted the turkey to make the gravy. <br> If your pan drippings look good, pour them into a heatproof measuring cup or fat separator. Measure the turkey fat (it\u2019ll be floating above the pan juices) and use it in your roux. As for the pan juices, don\u2019t toss that precious liquid! Add it, along with the meaty bits, to the cooked gravy. <br> Stock is the third player in gravy. Use either a homemade or good-quality store-bought gluten-free broth. If you use a commercial stock, be sure it\u2019s gluten-free. Opt for a no- or low-sodium stock. This way, you can adjust the amount of salt to your liking after you make the gravy. <br> How you add stock to the gluten-free roux matters. If you pour all the stock in at once, the roux tends to clump. Instead, pour about one cup of the stock into the roux while whisking constantly. The mixture will be very thick. Then, in a slow and steady stream, whisk in the remaining stock. <br> Prior to serving, keep the gravy warm over low heat. Stir occasionally to keep the gravy from scorching. <br> <br>Dress up the broth: <br>For Thanksgiving, I simmer store-bought turkey broth with some saut\u00e9ed onions and the turkey neck and giblets for about an hour while the turkey roasts, then I strain the stock before using it in the gravy.

        "How To Make Mulled Cider in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> Hot mulled cider is a must-have at all our fall and winter shindigs. It\u2019s probably a holdover from when we lived in New England and the frigid winters necessitated lots of hot beverages. But mulled cider is just so delicious and the smell so inviting, we serve it even in our mild California weather. Guests of all ages never seem to turn down a mug, and the adults especially relish the opportunity to do a little <br>self-spiking with their alcohol of choice<br>. <br> A slow cooker does double duty of both mulling the cider and keeping it warm for hours, making it the perfect appliance for this classic cold-weather beverage. <br> The most important ingredient for a good mulled apple cider is, of course, the apple cider. Apple cider can mean a few things, but here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need: Fresh apple cider that contains no added sugar or spices (those are sometimes labeled spiced apple cider), or unfiltered apple juice. <br> <br>Read more:<br> <br>What\u2019s the Difference Between Apple Cider and Apple Juice?<br> <br> A cloudy cider is the best visual clue you\u2019re buying the right beverage. It should come from the refrigerator section at the store. We\u2019re not using hard (alcoholic) cider here, the sparkling clear stuff from Martinelli\u2019s, nor apple juice. Apple juice tends to be sweetened and lacks all the deep flavor of fresh-pressed apple juice. <br> If you\u2019re lucky enough to find local, unpasteurized apple cider, grab it. (You can even freeze it!) Your mulled cider will be more complex and earthier than any pasteurized version. If you\u2019re worried about food safety, the slow cooker will basically pasteurize the cider as it cooks. <br> Once you\u2019ve got the right kind of cider, it\u2019s on to the spices. You can use a whole range of sweet spices, but the most basic combination is spicy fresh ginger, cinnamon sticks, and cloves. Feel free to add star anise, black peppercorns, or allspice berries to make this cider your own. <br> While the mulled cider may look pretty with all the spices floating on top, those little bits of spices do make it less pleasant to sip. To avoid getting bits of spices in every sip, tie up the spices in a little sachet made of cheesecloth or a coffee filter, or use a large tea ball instead. <br> Apple cider is plenty sweet on its own, so I don\u2019t add any sugar when I mull. I do however, like to add a whole sliced orange. Not only are the slices really festive-looking on top, but the fragrant orange peel and the juice really complement the apple and spice flavors. ",

        "How To Make Turkey Stock",
        "<br> When you really think about it, the whole Thanksgiving meal is one giant twofer. Next-day leftovers are just as important as the perfect day-of meal. The turkey, however, is even more generous. You get the bird on day one; the leftover meat for <br>sandwiches<br>, <br>enchiladas<br>, and <br>chilis<br> in the days after; and now you get this glorious sunny stock from the bones and bits leftover even after the meat is gone. <br> When it comes to making turkey stock, the best turkey is roasted turkey. Because we roast a larger bird, the leftover bones and bits of meat are plenty enough for making stock. Stock- and broth-making is typically dependent on collagen from the bones for thickening, and even roasted bones contain a fair amount. This stock won\u2019t set up as thickly as gelatin, but it will still be plenty rich and full of body. <br> <br>Pro tip:<br> When preparing your bird for roasting, remember to save the neck bone for stocking-making too. <br> If internally you\u2019re saying, \u201cYou really want me to make turkey stock after I\u2019ve already spent hours cooking a glorious feast?\u201d <br>let me tell you my secret<br>: While I\u2019m prepping for Thanksgiving, I prep for the stock as well. I put a gallon-sized zip-top bag in the fridge; throw a few ribs of chopped celery in there when<br> I make stuffing<br>; chop an extra carrot while <br>making grazed carrots<br>; put the neck bone in there after I prep the turkey; and then when we\u2019re done eating turkey, when the bird is picked clean, I already have a pre-made kit for turkey stock requiring nothing more than water, a hot pot, and patience. <br> Faith has some<br> feelings<br> about turkey and even more about turkey stock. Read why it\u2019s the only reason she makes a turkey at all for Thanksgiving. <br> <br>Turkey Is Gross. But Turkey Stock Is from God.<br> <br> Because the turkey has been seasoned before roasting, season the stock after it has cooked. A few stems of herbs, such as parsley or thyme, are nice additions to the stock while cooking, as are peppercorns, but these are purely optional. <br> Let\u2019s start with the obvious, of course: Make soup! Once you\u2019ve had your fill, try the stock in a delicious risotto or braise greens in this golden elixir. ",

        "<br> Thanksgiving wouldn\u2019t taste the same without pumpkin pie. This recipe gives you a gluten-free pumpkin pie from crust to filling that tastes just as good as the classic \u2014 and maybe even a little better. <br> Making pumpkin pie gluten-free is all about the crust, as pumpkin pie filling is already gluten-free. Any upgrades we make to the filling are only in the service of making it more delicious. <br> In this recipe we\u2019re using our standard <br>gluten-free pie crust recipe<br>, which you can (and probably should) make ahead of the big holiday rush so all you have to do is defrost the dough and pre-bake the crust before assembling the pie. <br> The crust of a pumpkin pie can turn soggy under the filling. It\u2019s easy to avoid this problem by pre-baking the crust. Bake the crust until it turns just golden-brown; any more than that and you risk the edges of the crust overbaking while the filling cooks. If you notice the edges are getting too dark, cover with a piece of foil. ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Apple Crisp",
        "<br> With warmer days in the rearview mirror, we have our sights narrowed in on fall baking. At the top of the must-cook list is apple crisp, the fuss-free cousin to apple pie. With the help of the slow cooker, we\u2019re making this easy fall classic even easier. <br> One of the things to love about making an apple crisp is that it doesn\u2019t require precision, or even exact measurements. This is more a guide than a recipe, allowing you plenty of leeway to make this slow-cooking crisp your own. Load up on extra cinnamon, cut it out all together, or swap it for a medley of other warming spices, like nutmeg, cardamom, and allspice. <br> The sweet, crisp topping of brown sugar, oats, and cinnamon that blankets the soft, stewed apples is arguably the most important element of this classic fall dessert. Unlike an oven, the slow cooker creates a moist environment which typically isn\u2019t conducive for crisp foods. <br> The secret to your crisp topping success in a slow cooker is paper towels. By draping a sheet of paper towels over the top of the slow cooker before placing the lid on, steam is absorbed and condensation is prevented from dripping onto the crisp topping. The result is an apple crisp topping that isn\u2019t soggy, but lightly browned and crunchy. ",

        "How To Make the Best Caesar Dressing",
        "<br> Classic Caesar salad dressing is deeply debated. A quick search on the internet will lead you to over one-million recipes, each of them different. Some claim the classic doesn\u2019t contain anchovies. There are recipes without egg yolks, and dressings made from tofu and even mayonnaise, but none of these are the <br>best <br>Caesar salad dressing. The best Caesar salad dressing starts with anchovies and garlic, and it creates an emulsion with raw egg yolks, mustard, and two types of oil. The best Caesar salad dressing is deceptively simple and delectable \u2014 and this is it. <br> What is it about these teeny fish that scares so many cooks? Canned anchovies pack a punch of flavor for being relatively inexpensive and readily available. They also keep almost forever, which makes them a worthy addition to any pantry. While some food historians note that Worcestershire sauce may have been the original source of briny, meaty flavor in classic Caesar salad, it\u2019s hard to fight the lure of anchovies in this classic dressing; oil-packed anchovies are best. <br> <br>Weigh In: <br>How Do You Feel About Anchovies?<br> <br> I love every form of egg yolk \u2014 sunny-side up, soft-boiled, and poached eggs make my heart flutter, but I recognize that many cooks are nervous about raw egg yolks. Sure, you can use super-fresh eggs from a reputable source (local chickens would be ideal), but those aren\u2019t always easy to find. If the idea of raw egg yolk makes you uncomfortable, look for pasteurized whole eggs at your local grocery store. Pasteurized eggs have been heated briefly to kill off bacteria, but otherwise resemble any other egg. <br> <br>Get the Facts: <br>What You Should Know About Food Safety and Eggs<br> <br> When making a classic vinaigrette, using straight olive oil is highly recommended \u2014 extra-virgin, if we are being specific. You\u2019ll truly enjoy the nuance of the oil when it has nothing but the vinegar to compete with. But that\u2019s not the case with Caesar dressing, which has garlic, additional fat from the egg yolk, and even the Parmesan cheese at the end to mask the flavor of a really nice olive oil. <br> For this dressing, we\u2019re using a small amount of olive oil (again, extra-virgin is really wonderful, but not required) and then finishing with a neutral oil of your choice. Vegetable oil is called for below, but you can easily use grapeseed, canola, or any other neutral oil instead. ",

        "How To Make Thanksgiving Stuffing in a Slow Cooker",
        "<br> When it comes to Thanksgiving side dishes, stuffing (or dressing, if you prefer) ranks up there at the top of my list. Holiday dinner simply isn\u2019t complete without it. <br> At its core, stuffing isn\u2019t a tricky dish to make, and this version is made even easier by using your slow cooker. No more vying for oven space. It\u2019s a set-it-and-forget-it side that requires just a little room on the counter and a few hours. And what you get in return is a classic stuffing filled with homey flavors, and plenty of crispy, toasty edges. <br> Stuffing can take on so many different iterations, so I thought it best to start with something basic and classic \u2014 a stuffing loaded with cubes of extra-dry bread, onion, celery, fresh herbs, stock, and a couple eggs to bring it together. It feels homey and comforting, with plenty of savory flavors; exactly the kind of stuffing I grew up eating year after year. <br> But should you want something more in your stuffing \u2014 diced apple, dried fruit, chopped nuts, crumbled sausage \u2014 there\u2019s room for that, too. This is just your starting point. Go ahead and add in some of your favorite goodies. Do remember that if you\u2019re adding sausage or any other type of meat, it should be cooked before mixing it into the stuffing. <br> My favorite part of oven-baked stuffing is the crisp, crunchy, extra-toasty layer that blankets the top of the dish. And it seems like everyone in my family loves this layer \u2014 it\u2019s a race to make sure we all get our share. <br> But I also love the soft pieces of bread, well-soaked with stock and infused with flavor from the fresh herbs and seasoning. Really, I want a little bit of each on my plate. <br> And here is where slow-cooker stuffing does not disappoint: The mix and blend of textures, both crisp and toasty, and soft and squishy, is really well-balanced. While this version doesn\u2019t yield a crunchy, toasted layer on top, that layer exists across the bottom and all around the sides of the slow-cooker bowl. Yes, you get even more crisp cubes of bread than you would when using the oven. And of course, the center of the bowl is packed with all the well-soaked, soft pieces. There\u2019s something for everyone, and plenty of it. <br> <br>Serves 12; makes about 12 cups<br> <br> <br>Ingredients<br> <br>1 (16- to 18-ounce) loaf rustic white or sourdough bread, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 10 cups)<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 medium onions, diced<br> 4 large stalks celery, diced<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh sage leaves<br> Leaves from 4 fresh thyme sprigs<br> 2 large eggs<br> 3 cups low-sodium turkey, chicken, or vegetable broth<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup diced apple, dried fruit, nuts (optional)<br> Cooking spray <br> <br>Equipment<br> Baking sheets<br> Cutting board<br> Chef\u2019s knife<br> Wooden spoon<br> Large frying pan<br> Measuring cup<br> Whisk<br> Large bowl<br> 7-quart slow cooker ",

        "Recipe: Hot Chocolate Snack Cake",
        "<br> The best part of playing outside on a snow day just might be coming inside for a steaming, creamy mug of hot cocoa. This wintry treat channels those snow-day vibes into an easy cake that comes together quickly, whether school was canceled or not. It\u2019s a dark, chocolatey cake that\u2019s finished with dollops of marshmallow creme \u2014 because no hot chocolate is complete unless it\u2019s crowned with some melty marshmallow. <br> Fall and winter can mean that the temperature in your kitchen is cooler, which means that butter takes longer to soften before you can use it. This cake skips that step completely by using <br>Country Crock\u00ae Baking Sticks<br>, which are a 1:1 substitute for butter, instead. Just start creaming these sticks with the sugar straight out of the refrigerator before adding in the dry ingredients and the cocoa powder that\u2019s bloomed in coffee for a deep, dark chocolate flavor. In fact, this cake batter assembles so quickly that all you\u2019ll have to wait on is the oven to finish preheating! <br> This snack cake is baked in a trusty 9\u00d713-inch pan, so it makes enough to feed a crowd and is easy to transport, but the little twist that makes it a touch more special is the fluff that gets decoratively swirled into the cake batter before it goes in the oven. It\u2019s a delicious excuse to buy a jar of marshmallow creme, but it also means you\u2019ll have leftover fluff to make fluffernutter sandwiches, bake another hot chocolate snack cake, or, of course, serve on top of hot chocolate. <br> If you\u2019re in charge of dessert at the next holiday gathering, this is an easy cake to bring that\u2019s guaranteed to be popular. You can even add some festive flair by sprinkling some crushed candy canes on the cake batter before swirling the marshmallow creme in if you\u2019re a peppermint hot chocolate type of person. <br> <br>This post was created by the Kitchn Creative Studio and is sponsored by Country Crock. <br> Thank you for supporting the brands that make Kitchn possible.<br> ",

        "Recipe: Cranberry-Oat Breakfast Muffins",
        "<br> At the end of every year comes the fun ritual where cranberry bogs are flooded to harvest the tart fruit that is turkey\u2019s best friend. As cranberries make their way into grocery stores in fresh, frozen, and canned form, take advantage of their appearance and add some fall flair to breakfast with these cranberry-oat muffins. Made with a double dose of cranberry, these hearty muffins can work as a treat for houseguests or as an on-the-go breakfast on a busy weekday morning. <br> These muffins are easy and quick enough that they can be whipped up in the morning if you\u2019re feeling like muffins for breakfast. The muffin batter uses <br>Country Crock Baking Sticks<br>, which can be used straight out of the refrigerator without any softening. Made with sunflower oil, they can replace butter in any recipe (just use a 1:1 ratio) and have a great buttery flavor to complement the oats, cinnamon, and brown sugar in these muffins. <br> Cranberries are the star of the show here, and they\u2019re used in two forms. First, cranberry sauce gets mixed into the batter, tinging it just a touch pink and adding jam-like flavor into each bite. Next, whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) are folded in for tart pops of flavor. But there\u2019s one more surprise bonus: Some cranberry sauce gets spooned onto each muffin before baking for a little pocket of fruity fun. <br> If you need a hostess gift or want an easy, festive holiday morning breakfast, these muffins are it. But don\u2019t think that they can only be enjoyed during cranberry season: If you stock up on cranberries and freeze them, you can enjoy these muffins any time of year! <br> <br>This post was created by the Kitchn Creative Studio and is sponsored by Country Crock. <br> Thank you for supporting the brands that make Kitchn possible.<br> ",

        "<br> Figuring out which cookies to bake during the holiday season can seem daunting \u2014 especially if you don\u2019t like having to frost cookies or do multiple rounds of cutting and baking. Here\u2019s a cookie that fits the bill if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s easy to make and full of that iconic gingerbread flavor we crave in the winter! Plus, it has a fun twist that makes it stand out on a cookie plate: chocolate! <br> These soft, chewy chocolate gingerbread cookies are made with <br>Country Crock\u00ae Baking Sticks<br>, which can be used right out of the refrigerator, no softening needed. That means you don\u2019t have to wait around like you would for butter to soften before you can get baking! Made of sunflower oil and full of buttery flavor, these sticks cream right into a cookie dough that\u2019s rich with molasses and holiday spices. <br> The cookie dough gets two hits of chocolate. You can see the first, the chocolate chips, before you even take your first bite. But the second comes as a surprise. A little bit of cocoa powder gets mixed into the batter to mingle with the molasses and spices so that you get a taste of chocolate in each bite. <br> Just realized you signed up for the office potluck or that you should bring something for the host of tomorrow night\u2019s party? Chocolate gingerbread cookies are the perfect gift for the season, and the Country Crock Baking Sticks are the trick that lets you whip them up and get them in the oven quickly the night before. Just remember to make a double batch so you have some to enjoy with a steaming cup of tea. <br> <br>This post was created by the Kitchn Creative Studio and is sponsored by Country Crock. <br> Thank you for supporting the brands that make Kitchn possible.<br> ",

        "Recipe: Upside-Down Pear Cake",
        "<br> During the holiday season, you may feel the pressure to make elaborate sweets and desserts that require rolling pins, cookie cutters, or too much fuss over frosting and decorating. But there are plenty of elegant and delicious desserts that are easy to pull off, and this upside-down pear cake is one of them. <br> Tender, gingery cake is topped off with juicy slices of pear that sit in a gooey caramel glaze that drips down the sides. It\u2019s an easy skillet cake that can be assembled in the 20 minutes it takes for the oven to heat up. <br> One of the reasons this cake is so easy is that it uses <br>Country Crock Baking Sticks<br>, which don\u2019t require any softening and can be used straight out of the refrigerator. These handy sticks are made with sunflower oil and do double duty in this cake: they\u2019re melted into the topping for a sweet glaze and also creamed into the cake batter. Skipping the softening step means that you don\u2019t have to wait and can go straight to mixing. <br> The best part of upside-down cakes is how they look so impressive without any elaborate decorating. Simply arrange ripe pear slices in a pretty pattern on top of the glaze, then top with the cake batter before baking. Once the cake is flipped out of the skillet (which is a fun <br>ta-da!<br> moment \u2014 you might want to do this move tableside), there\u2019s nothing more to do but slice and serve. <br> Pear skillet cake is easy enough to pull off on a weeknight, yet fancy enough to grace a holiday dessert table or to stand out in a sea of pies. It\u2019s just the ticket any time you\u2019re tasked to make dessert. <br> <br>This post was created by the Kitchn Creative Studio and is sponsored by Country Crock. <br> Thank you for supporting the brands that make Kitchn possible.<br> ",

        "Recipe: Maple Pecan Pie Bars",
        "<br> I\u2019ve always felt very neutral about pecan pie. You won\u2019t ever find me rushing to make pecan pie, but I certainly won\u2019t turn down a slice if it comes my way. These maple \u201cpecan pie\u201d bars, on the other hand, are a fantastically different thing. In fact, they are everything I\u2019ve always wished pecan pie would be, I just didn\u2019t know it yet. <br> Maybe I\u2019m just overly particular, but it\u2019s rare when I find a pecan pie that strikes a perfect balance of, well, pecan and pie. Maybe it\u2019s <br>too<br> ooey-gooy, or perhaps it has a soggy crust, or possibly the flavor even falls a little flat. And considering my Southern roots and penchant for redoing recipes, one would think I\u2019d have come up with my own solution already. <br> But nope, it wasn\u2019t until I was given the oh-so-tough (yeah, right) assignment for our <br>Thanksgiving Gathering this year <br>\u2014 to create a perfect pecan pie in handheld form \u2014 that I even stopped to think about it. But think about it I did, and what resulted was a fairly simple yet very amazing dessert. As it turns out, putting pecan pie in bar form eliminated those otherwise fatal flaws I mentioned. <br> My recipe renovation started with considering the crust. I wanted the ease of shortbread but one that didn\u2019t crumble if you looked at it wrong, and so I had to to think about both ingredients and technique. Ultimately I decided on a blend of <br>cake flour and all-purpose flour<br>, to yield a tender yet durable crust. I replaced more traditional powdered sugar with<br> brown sugar<br>, to better marry with the flavors with the impending filling. Of course <br>high-quality butter <br>was essential, and a splash of <br>vanilla<br> just seemed like the right thing to do. <br> After looking up a million different shortbread techniques \u2014 food processor, stand mixer, pastry cutter \u2014 the method that grabbed my attention from a few different websites was for a melt-the-butter, pour-it and press-it-in kind of crust (think graham cracker or chocolate wafer). I\u2019ll admit I was intrigued but not optimistic. But I went for it anyway, and boy, was I wrong. It was so delicious, not to mention the easiest thing in the history of ever \u2014 no more dragging out special equipment or stressing about over-processing the dough! <br> For the filling, I wanted a firm texture with a complex taste that managed to still be all about the pecans. Personally I think maple is the quintessential pairing for this favorite nut, so it seemed like a no-brainer to use it for these bars, while brown sugar and butter added a caramel note. I finished off the filling with a dollop of creme fraiche and a healthy glug of vanilla extract to add a luxe finish to the dish. A generous pinch of salt brought each of the elements together. <br> The true test, however, would be if the individual parts would harmonize as a whole. And so I waited rather (im)patiently for the caramel-y pecan bars to set before I went at them with my knife. I politely sat down at my desk with an adorable sliver, ready to examine my creation. And then I meandered back in the kitchen, because I \u201cneeded\u201d to \u201ctest\u201d it a little bit more. With every tiny slice came another, then another, until I balked at the fact I had just managed to Pac-Man half the pan. (And while calorie counting isn\u2019t really my thing, I vaguely understood the diet crime I had probably just committed.) <br> But oh-my-gosh, I couldn\u2019t resist! It was so. Very. Good. When I finally came up for air, I had to call for reinforcements. (a.k.a my very generous friends who come to \u201ctake these kinds of things away.\u201d) And so a few neighborhood pals arrived to save me from myself, but they too caved under the pecan pie pressure. We were all just too weak. <br> To put its yumminess into perspective I made it two more times that week and have plenty of plans for more. I have a funny feeling its simplicity might be the end of me. (Which I guess means so much for death by chocolate?) ",

        "How To Make the Very Best Thanksgiving Stuffing",
        "<br> Turkey gets the magazine covers and the big platters, but let\u2019s be real \u2014 stuffing is the star of the show, at least on <br>my <br>table. And when I say stuffing, I mean the most classic, herby, moist, and fragrant bread stuffing \u2014 just like what you get out of the box, but even better. <br> Here\u2019s how to make that stuffing you crave, the one that is so indelibly connected with Thanksgiving, any time you like. It\u2019s remarkably simple, and oh so good. <br> Now, some nomenclature. <br>Stuffing <br>is what I call the bready-casserole-goodness that soaks up gravy and sits besides the turkey. Technically, however, this is just bread dressing. It\u2019s only stuffing if it\u2019s baked inside the turkey, which I almost never do. <br> I don\u2019t stuff my turkey partly because there are very real health hazards and a need to make sure that stuffing is completely cooked. It also makes the turkey cook more slowly. <br> But I don\u2019t let the name trip me up; stuffing this is, to me, and it will always remain so. If it confuses you, though, then dressing it is. <br> People get serious about their stuffing. Oysters? Sausage? Cornbread? Keep \u2019em off my table. But I know that others feel differently. However, I would argue that for a majority of Americans (sweeping generalizations, love them) this taste of herbs and onion, so similar to <br>classic Stove Top from a box<br>, is the taste that is quintessentially Thanksgiving. <br> We set out to recreate that taste in a simple, from-scratch recipe that can be prepped ahead and baked while the turkey finishes. <br> The alchemy of this recipe is really wonderful \u2014 when you\u2019re mixing dried bread, herbs, and butter, it doesn\u2019t seem possible that all of it will come together in that silky, homestyle stuffing you crave. But pour in a good measure of turkey broth and butter, and suddenly this is a moist and fluffy Thanksgiving classic. <br> Now, I can\u2019t give you this recipe without one big caveat, and that is broth. A simple stuffing or bread dressing like this one has a bare handful of ingredients, so they really have to count. And the single biggest boost you can give your homemade stuffing is turkey broth. <br> Sure, boxed chicken or vegetable broth will do just fine, but the best stuffing is made with rich, savory, homemade turkey broth \u2014 the richer, the better. That flavor is what you want. ",

        "Recipe: Pumpkin Slab Pie",
        "<br> It\u2019s been said that whomever coined the phrase \u201ceasy as pie\u201d had never made one from scratch. Perhaps, instead, they were talking about this pretty slab pie. Slab pie solves problems during the hubbub of Thanksgiving feast preparation. Here\u2019s why: <br> First, a slab pie feeds a crowd, yielding at least 24 generous servings. If there are fewer guests around your table, leftovers hold well for days. <br> Second, this is a low-stress, high-success approach to homemade pie crust. It comes together quickly in a food processor (or bowl) and is pressed into the baking pan. No rolling. No crimping. No worries. <br> Third, the filling works equally well with canned or home-cooked fresh pumpkin. <br> There are two secrets to preparing perfect pumpkin pur\u00e9e to use in recipes such as this one. <br> But either way \u2014 canned or homemade \u2014 this pie will be beautiful, delicious, and easy as only a (slab) pie can be. <br> <br>Makes 24 pieces<br> <br> <br>For the crust: <br> <br>3 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes and chilled<br> 1/2 cup vegetable shortening, cut into small cubes and chilled<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar<br> 5 to 7 tablespoons ice water <br> <br>For the streusel topping:<br> <br>1 cup rolled oats<br> 1 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes and chilled<br> 1/2 cup coarsely broken pecan halves<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger <br> <br>For the pumpkin filling:<br> <br>6 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 2 (15-ounce) cans pumpkin pur\u00e9e, or 3 1/2 cups homemade pumpkin pur\u00e9e (Recipe follows)<br> 1 cup heavy cream <br> <br>Make the crust:<br> Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and pulse to combine. Scatter the cubes of butter and shortening over the flour and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand with a few pieces of fat the size of small peas. <br> Place the egg, vinegar, and 5 tablespoons of the ice water in a small bowl and whisk until well-blended. Pour over the flour mixture and pulse to form large clumps of dough; if it doesn\u2019t hold together, sprinkle in more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse only until incorporated. Transfer the clumps onto a work surface and gather into a smooth ball. <br> Press the dough evenly across the bottom and up the sides of a rimmed baking sheet (half sheet pan). Use your fingers or the bottom of a metal measuring cup to press the dough evenly into the pan and against the edges \u2014 the edges should be straight, not sloped. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. <br> <br>Make the streusel: <br>Place the oats, brown sugar, and flour in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and work it into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or fingertips until the mixture is crumbly. Pinch together about 1/3 of the mixture into balls the size of a marble; leave the rest crumbly. Gently stir in the pecans and ginger. Cover and refrigerate until the butter is firm, at least 30 minutes. <br> <br> Make the filling and bake the pie.<br> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350\u00baF. Place the eggs, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Add the pumpkin and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the cream. Pour the filling into the chilled pie crust and smooth the top. <br> Bake until the filling just begins to set, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle the chilled streusel evenly over filling. Bake until the filling is set and the streusel is golden-brown, about 25 minutes more. The tip of a sharp knife inserted into the center should come out clean. <br> Cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. <br> Be sure to use a pumpkin made for eating, such as a pie pumpkin, sugar baby, or cheese pumpkin. Most winter squashes, like butternuts, make good \u201cpumpkin\u201d pur\u00e9e as well. <br>Do not use large Halloween pumpkins<br>; they are meant only for carving, and will taste flavorless, stringy, and watery. <br> Heat the oven to 400\u00baF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut the pumpkin in half from top to bottom. If the pumpkin weighs more than 4 pounds, cut it into large wedges. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Place the pieces cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until it is easily pierced with a knife, 45 to 90 minutes depending on the size and type of pumpkin. Let cool enough to handle and then scoop the flesh from the shells. <br> Pur\u00e9e the flesh in a food processor or force it through a food mill into a bowl. The pur\u00e9e must have the thick, firm consistency of canned pumpkin. If it is too watery, spoon it into a sieve lined with a couple of layers of white paper towels or a large coffee filter set over a bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the pur\u00e9e. Refrigerate overnight. Discard the collected liquid. Store covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months. <br> <br>Using jelly roll pans: <br>This recipe can also be made in 2 jelly roll pans; double the amount of pie crust. <br> <br>Storage: <br>The bars can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.

        "How To Make Classic Pumpkin Pie for Thanksgiving",
        "<br> Everyone\u2019s got a pumpkin pie recipe they love. This one is ours. We\u2019ve tried this classic each and every way and have found that while there\u2019s some room for improvement along the way, keeping things classic is what makes this recipe a keeper. Any changes \u2014 like roasting the pumpkin pur\u00e9e \u2014 are only in the interest of making a richer, more flavorful pie. <br> Here\u2019s what you need to know to make a truly delicious pumpkin pie from scratch. <br> Variations abound on pumpkin pie, from deep dish to crumb coated, but when we talk about classic pumpkin pie here\u2019s what we mean: a pumpkin custard that is sweetened and lightly spiced, baked until creamy but sliceable in a crisp pie crust. It\u2019s the pie most guests expect at Thanksgiving and one we think every home cook should master. Here\u2019s how to do it. <br> A soggy crust is the curse of many a good pie, particularly custard-based ones like our dear pumpkin. To help avoid this, partially bake the crust before adding the filling (i.e., \u201c<br>blind bake<br>\u201d the crust). <br> If you\u2019ve never done this before, don\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s easy. Just roll out the crust and fit it into the pan. Then, line it with a piece of parchment paper and fill the bottom with pie weights, dried beans, or even pennies. The weights help keep the bottom from puffing up and the sides from slouching. Bake for about 15 minutes, remove the weights, bake for another few minutes to dry out the bottom, and you\u2019re ready to go. <br> This is a trick I picked up from Cook\u2019s Illustrated a while back: Run the pumpkin pur\u00e9e in a food processor or blender for a minute before proceeding on with the recipe. Even though canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e is already, yes, <br>pur\u00e9ed<br>, fibrous stringy bits often remain. Pur\u00e9eing the pur\u00e9e helps ensure a silky-smooth texture. <br> When I say \u201ccook\u201d here, I really just mean to let the pumpkin pur\u00e9e bubble on the stovetop for about five minutes. I find that this brief kiss of warmth helps cook out the raw pumpkin flavor and give the finished pie much more depth. It also melts the sugar into the pur\u00e9e and infuses it with the spices for an all-around richer, more complex flavor. <br> To make sure that the filling and the crust fuse into a single delicious creation, add the warm filling to the warm crust. Don\u2019t get too fussy about this \u2014 I know that the blind-baked crust and the warmed filling might not be ready in perfect synchrony. I mention it only because it\u2019s a detail that pumpkin pie-lovers will appreciate. ",

        "French Recipe: Creamy Butternut Squash Casserole with Herbed Bread Crumbs",
        "<br> When you think of casseroles, do the words <br>elegant<br> and <br>beautiful<br> come to your mind? Probably not. Casseroles have many admirable qualities, but they are of the plainer, stodgier sort. Unless, that is, they are French. <br> The French have an elegant answer to the homey casserole, and it\u2019s the Proven\u00e7al <br>tian<br>. This musical word signifies a gratin, French-style. <br> A tian doesn\u2019t have too much to set it apart from its plainer cousins, but all the variations I\u2019ve tried have had just an edge of sophistication, a dash of something special. Take this one, for instance, which I learned from Rosa Jackson, a food writer and teacher in Nice, France. It starts with a base of creamy, Parmesan-flecked orange squash, and bakes up with a green crust of garlicky herbed bread crumbs. You can practically taste the South of France: olive oil, sun-kissed vegetables, garlic, and rosemary. This is how the French do casseroles. <br> I took a <br>cooking class with Rosa<br> a few years ago, and it happened to be just as I was starting to write a cookbook about casseroles. I was looking for fresh inspiration, and I found it in this delicious tian. <br> It is a little more involved than many of the other casseroles I make. You chop and cook the butternut squash (or pumpkin, or Red Kuri squash \u2014 my favorite) until it is soft. Then mash it up with a little parboiled rice to soak up any extra moisture, plus Parmesan and eggs. The topping is a scrumptious Proven\u00e7al bread crumb mix of parsley, rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. Blended in the food processor, the crumbs turn bright green and make a delightfully colorful topping for the orange squash below. <br> But the results are so worth it. The squash is creamy yet firm, savory from Parmesan and a traditional French touch of nutmeg. Spooning through you get the taste of all those toasty, garlicky herb and crumbs, then the creamy squash below. It\u2019s substantial enough to be a main dish, accompanied by nothing more than a good salad. But it\u2019s also a pleasant side dish for chicken, duck, and pork \u2014 it sits elegantly on nearly any table, and that\u2019s just not something you can say about every casserole. Leave it to the French. <br> This is not your ordinary squash casserole, but instead a welcome change to the candy-sweet variations that cross our tables each fall. Butternut squash is cooked until tender, then studded with parboiled arborio rice (the variety usually reserved for risotto) and seasoned with nutty Parmesan. A pair of eggs add body and richness to the casserole. But for me, the star of this dish is the Provencal bread crumbs. I\u2019m used to tossing bread crumbs with butter and salt or even mixing in hard cheeses to add crunch and flavor to the top of a casserole. But in this recipe, fresh parsley, thyme, and garlic transform dried bread crumbs into a fragrant and elegant topping. It makes a generous amount of bread crumbs, so you might not need use it all. Freeze the remainder and use for topping other casseroles, sprinkling onto salads and scrambled eggs, or breading chicken and fish. <br> <br>\u2013<br>Patty<br>, November 2018<br> <br> <br>Recipe adapted from <br>Rosa Jackson<br> Serves 4<br> <br> <br>For the herbed bread crumbs:<br> <br>1 cup (4 ounces) dried bread crumbs<br> 1 big handful (about 1/2 cup) flat leaf parsley leaves<br> Leaves from 3 to 4 sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary<br> 2 cloves garlic, peeled<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper, to taste <br> <br>For the tian:<br> 1 (2 to 2 1/2-pound) butternut squash <br> 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> 1/4 cup short-grain or arborio rice<br> 1 cup (2 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br> 2 large eggs, beaten<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> Freshly ground black pepper, to taste <br> <br>Make the bread crumbs: <br>In a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, blend together all the ingredients except the olive oil. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and blend until the bread crumbs are soft and green, adding a little more oil 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary. Season well with salt and pepper. <br> If not using right away, keep airtight in the refrigerator or freezer (in a plastic bag or jar) until you need them. <br> <br>Make the tian: <br>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375\u00b0F. Lightly grease a 1 1/2 to 2-quart baking dish (such as a deep pie dish) with olive oil; set aside. <br> Peel and slice the butternut squash into 1/2-inch thick slices. You should have 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds prepared squash flesh. Heat the olive oil in a deep saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Cook the squash in the olive oil with 1/2 teaspoon salt until it softens and starts to disintegrate, 20 to 25 minutes. Cover for most of the cooking time to speed the process, stirring occasionally. <br> While the squash is cooking, heat a small saucepan of salted water over high heat. When it is boiling, add the rice. Cook for 10 minutes, then drain and set aside. <br> Place the cooked butternut squash in a large bowl and combine with the rice, Parmesan, nutmeg, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds black pepper. When it has cooled slightly, mix in the eggs quickly so that they don\u2019t scramble. The mixture may seem on the liquid side, but this is fine. Pour it into the prepared baking dish, top with the herbed bread crumbs, and a generous drizzle of olive oil. (If desired, you can prepare to this point, cover and refrigerate for up to two days. When ready to serve, bake as directed below.) <br> Bake until slightly toasted on top and set, 25 to 35 minutes. Serve warm. <br> <br>Storage: <br>Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. <br> <br>Doubling: <br>This recipe doubles very well; I use a 4-pound squash and bake the tian in a 9\u00d713-inch baking dish.

        "How To Make Perfect Mashed Potatoes for Thanksgiving",
        "<br> Is there nothing more comforting and delicious than mashed potatoes? This warm, creamy, dairy-laden starch might be more of an indulgence than everyday fare these days, but even if you only have them once a year (Thanksgiving!), I say go all out and do it right. Read on for a recipe for classic mashed potatoes, with recommendations for potato type, dairy additions, and mashing methods. <br> Folks have been wielding the potato masher in the kitchen for generations, so if this is your preferred method, I say stick with it. I used a ricer for testing this recipe, and while I feel it results in superior potatoes (less lumps, more fluff) I actually prefer a food mill which, besides also producing less lumps and more fluff, separates the skins so no peeling is necessary. I also find it easier to use than the ricer, which is really a two-person process: one to peel, another to rice. <br> <br>Don\u2019t ever use a blender or food processor<br> to whip your potatoes! You will end up with glue and then you (and your guests) will be sad. <br> Choosing the proper potatoes is critical. There are basically three types of potatoes: very starchy like Russets, very waxy like Red Bliss, and somewhere in the middle like Yukon Golds. First rule: <br>Don\u2019t use the waxy, red potatoes for your mash<br>. They just won\u2019t break down enough (read: lumps), nor do they absorb the dairy very well. Stick with Russets and Yukon Golds. Of the two, the Russet will give you the creamiest mash, but many people prefer the flavor and golden color of Yukon Golds. It\u2019s a trade-off and totally up to you. <br> <br>I don\u2019t peel or slice my potatoes before cooking them<br>. The reason for this is threefold: Unpeeled and unsliced potatoes will absorb less water while being boiled, preserving the starch within the potato. Less water avoids a gluey, watery mash and allows the potatoes to absorb the dairy. Plus, the potato peels contribute to the overall potato flavor. And finally, taking the peels off after cooking is quicker and easier. <br> If you using a food mill, the skins will be removed as a part of the milling process. You may have to clear them out of the mill now and again, but really it\u2019s the most efficient method in my book. If you don\u2019t have a food mill, you will have to peel the potatoes when they\u2019re hot. I found, however, that in the case with the Yukon Golds, the skins were already peeling off just from their dump into the colander. I picked up each potato, held it in a potholder-covered hand, and used a paring knife to coax off the rest of the skins. <br> It is important that your dairy is warmed up before adding it to your mash and that you add the butter first. The amount of water in the half-and-half combines with the starch molecules, which makes the potatoes gluey. When you add the butter first, it coats the starch and results in silkier potatoes<br>.<br> Then add the half-and-half. <br> Butter will be one of your primary flavors in mashed potatoes, so use the best quality you can. I use unsalted in this recipe so I can control the salt. If you want to use salted, do not add the additional salt in step 2 and simply taste and add salt as needed in the final seasoning. <br> Additionally, I use half-and-half for the liquid as I think it\u2019s plenty rich enough. You can use cream if you want for over the top, decadently wonderful results. ",

        "How To Make Perfect Cheesecake",
        "<br> Cheesecake should never be a source of anything except pure bliss. Not distress. Not frustration. Certainly never tears. Just dreamy, decadent, nonstop bliss. <br> So let\u2019s break down this whole process into easy pieces. Let\u2019s talk about ingredients, water baths, dealing with surface cracks \u2014 the whole shebang. Here\u2019s a step-by-step recipe that will help you make a creamy, no-fail cheesecake that is everything you ever dreamed it could be. <br> Let\u2019s talk for a minute about the cream cheese \u2014 a very important ingredient in cheesecake. Some people have brand loyalty to Philadelphia, and I won\u2019t deny that this cream cheese makes a particularly silky and lush cheesecake. I\u2019ve also made cheesecakes with local brands and off brands and been perfectly happy. <br> No matter what, buy full-fat cream cheese. Cheesecake is not the time to skimp. <br> But as delicious as cream cheese is, it needs some helpers to become a tasty cheesecake. Most recipes either use heavy cream or sour cream; either will do the job of softening the texture of the cheese and adding some moisture. Personally, I prefer sour cream because I like the extra hit of sour tang it adds to the cake. <br> You also need a few eggs to hold the cake together. Three whole eggs do the trick quite nicely. I also add an extra yolk, which enhances the cake\u2019s velvety texture. (Whites tend to lighten the cake, which is actually fine \u2014 if you don\u2019t feel like separating that fourth egg and don\u2019t mind some extra airiness in the texture, just add in the whole egg.) <br> A little bit of cornstarch or flour in the cheesecake batter is insurance against cracking and makes the cake easier to cut into clean slices, though it does change the texture of the cheesecake a bit. Starch makes the cheesecake more firm and sturdy, while a cheesecake that relies on eggs alone has a softer, super-creamy texture. <br> I have tried both and love both. I feel like the texture difference is actually quite slight \u2014 it might be noticeable in a side-by-side comparison, but it would take a true cheesecake connoisseur to distinguish one on its own. Go whichever route makes you happiest. <br> A water bath isn\u2019t <br>strictly<br> needed if you use starch in your recipe, and there are some methods for cooking even a starchless cheesecake on its own, but I still stand by this method. A water bath helps cook the cheeseake <br>oh so <br>gently while also creating a steamy environment so the surface doesn\u2019t get too dry. It\u2019s like a day spa for the cheesecake, and makes it supremely smooth and creamy. <br> A water bath is also not that hard. Just set the cheesecake in a roasting pan or other large baking dish, fill it with a few inches of water, and put the whole contraption in the oven. Wrapping the cheesecake pan in foil also helps keep any water from seeping through the cracks of the pan. <br> There are two main reasons why your cheesecake might form cracks: Overcooking and too-fast cooling. Both are entirely preventable. Cook your cheesecake until the outer ring of the cake is slightly puffed and fairly firm, but the inner circle still jiggles like barely set Jell-o. A few toasty golden spots are fine, but if you see any small cracks forming, immediately move on to the cooling step. <br> When cooling, do it gradually. Let the cheesecake sit in the turned-off oven with the door cracked for about an hour, then remove it from the water bath and let it cool completely on the stovetop. When you remove it from the waterbath, also run a thin-bladed knife around the edge to make sure the cake isn\u2019t sticking to the pan, which can also cause cracks as the cake settles. <br> A cheesecake is a make-ahead cake in the sense that you <br>have<br> to make it ahead. After all the careful baking and slow cooling, the cheesecake still needs to chill in the fridge and finish setting up for at least four hours or (ideally) overnight. <br> If you cut into the cheesecake before chilling, it will have a firm custardy texture, like flan, and you will think that you\u2019ve done something terribly wrong. But <br>after<br> chilling, it will have transformed into that velvety, creamy, lush cheesecake that we all know and love. It\u2019s like magic. <br> There are a few moments in this process when you may think that all is lost. I want to set your mind at ease. <br> <br>Mastered the basic cheesecake? Try pumpkin cheesecake next! <br>How To Make Pumpkin Cheesecake<br> <br> You are now armed with the knowledge you need to make the best cheesecake ever. Use the recipe below, or just apply these steps and techniques to your next cheesecake \u2014 either way, cheesecake bliss awaits. <br> Flawless and foolproof. This is a high standard for a dessert fraught with the potential for error, but it truly is. With clear and specific instructions, it was as if I had a friend holding my hand at each step. I took Emma\u2019s suggestions, using cornstarch as insurance against cracking and including sour cream for its tang to cut through the dense, richness of the cheesecake. I baked my cake in a 9-inch springform pan, making sure that there was a tight seal of aluminum foil before pouring in the water for the bath. Straightforward instruction on what to look for in batter texture and the wiggle-jiggle of the finished cake made me breathe a little easier. The result was a rich, creamy, and tangy cake, with no signs of cracking. I served this to friends welcoming a new baby, and before I left a quarter of the cake was already gone. If you\u2019ve never tried to bake a cheesecake, or have tried before and failed, tie on your apron and get baking with this recipe by your side. \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, April 2018<br> <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the home?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> ",

        "How To Make Classic Green Bean Casserole",
        "<br> \u201cClassic\u201d green bean casserole means different things to different people. For some, green bean casserole consists of frozen and canned ingredients, quickly tossed together and baked as the token green vegetable for the Thanksgiving table. Others see green bean casserole as an opportunity to make every component from scratch, using only fresh green beans and making their own mushroom sauce and crispy fried onions. This is the new classic, a middle ground between convenience and comfort, without a sacrifice of quality or flavor. <br> My mother always made green bean casserole with store-bought canned green beans because her mother made green bean casserole with canned green beans. But my grandmother\u2019s canned green beans were picked and canned from her home garden. When I make green bean casserole, I skip canned all together and head for the freezer instead because <br>frozen green beans are the best green beans to use for green bean casserole<br>. <br> Frozen green beans are blanched and flash-frozen, usually within a few hours of picking, which means they have their peak-season flavor preserved and don\u2019t require any additional cooking before going into the casserole. Just be sure to thaw and drain the green beans before adding to the casserole \u2014 otherwise their excess moisture may thin the mushroom gravy. <br> <br>Tip: <br>Quickly thaw the green beans by placing them under running water in a colander. Let the beans drain while you prepare the rest of the casserole. <br> Old-school green bean casserole uses condensed mushroom soup as the sauce for the green beans. Historically, the marketing geniuses at Campbell\u2019s and French\u2019s were responsible for the popularity of green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. Nothing against condensed mushroom soup, but we can make a simple mushroom sauce (technically a gravy) that is more flavorful, and not much more expensive, with just a few ingredients: mushrooms, butter, flour, milk, and broth. If you\u2019ve made a pan gravy in the past, the steps are familiar, but if not, here a few keys to success. <br> <br>Make-ahead tip:<br> Assemble the casserole without the crisp onion topping and store tightly wrapped in the refrigerator for up to three days. Remove from the refrigerator while the oven preheats. Top with the fried onions and bake. <br> Look, I have tried every method for making crispy onions for green bean casserole. I\u2019ve tried rolling onion in breadcrumbs and roasting them. I\u2019ve tempura battered and fried them. I\u2019ve even tried dehydrating onions into a crispy state. Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 no method comes close to the ease and flavor of the canned fried onions. Beyond being more convenient, I\u2019d argue that there is a historical precedent for using fried onions from a can, as they were included in the original Campbell\u2019s recipe published in 1955. <br> <br>Read more on the history of green bean casserole<br>: <br>The Thanksgiving Staple We Love \u2014 or Loathe<br> ",

        "Recipe: Pumpkin Pie Pancakes",
        "<br> Although I get pretty weary of the pumpkin madness that hits the universe come October \u2014 I\u2019m looking at you, Starbucks \u2014 there are two things I\u2019ll make an exception for: bread pudding and pancakes. And since this post is clearly not about bread pudding, let\u2019s talk about what we like to call \u201cPum\u2019Cakes\u201d around our house. They\u2019re so good! <br> I first discovered pumpkin pancakes at The Griddle Cafe, a famous Hollywood eatery in a town not usually known for things such as pancakes. I am usually a savory breakfast kind of girl, but hey, when in L.A., do as the Angelenos do. <br> So I ordered from \u201cthe griddle\u201d at The Griddle, and it was a choice I wouldn\u2019t regret. What arrived on my plate was a triple stack of the largest, fluffiest, pumpkin-est hot cakes I\u2019ve ever seen. As if that weren\u2019t enough, they were smothered in powdered sugar, slapped in butter, and finished off with a mountain of whipped cream. The calories were worth it, but these pancakes might also explain the popularity of SoCal juice bars. (Roll me to one, please.) <br> And so my love affair with pumpkin pancakes began. I have ordered them at restaurants and even attempted them at home, dabbling with amounts and ingredients over the years. They have always been pretty good, but never quite \u201cThe Griddle\u201d good. <br> Until now, that is. I finally decided to put my head down and get serious, and I hope you\u2019ll be glad I did. Perfecting the pancakes meant more than a few cans of pumpkin and a heck of a lot of pancakes, but it was a small price to pay and I was more than willing. At first glance these won\u2019t seem much different than any run-of-the-mill pumpkin pancakes, but I do have a few tricks up my sleeve: <br> All of the dry ingredients are whisked together per usual, but I combine all of the liquid ingredients in a blender \u2014 to make it a bit more like pumpkin pie, if you will. You don\u2019t risk overworking the batter by adding the flour, but you still get plenty of silkiness and spice. <br> My second trick is to <br>fold in the egg whites<br> at the end, a trick I learned right here on The Kitchn. (Thanks, Dana!) It really does help yield a supremely lofty pancake. And my last insistence is to cook the cakes on a sizzling cast iron griddle with a healthy glug of oil. They get a little bit caramelized and a little bit crispy \u2014 the ultimate breakfast bite. <br> So there you have it, my idea of the quintessential pumpkin pancake. I think L.A. definitely got this one right: \u2019tis <br>always<br> the season for Pum\u2019cakes! ",

        "How To Make the Best Macaroni and Cheese on the Stove",
        "<br> This is the macaroni and cheese recipe I grew up on \u2014 creamy sauce, chewy pasta, and plenty of cheese. It always felt like a special treat to us kids, although I suspect my mother liked it more because it was an easy stovetop dish that requires just five ingredients and almost no thought to pull together at the end of a long day. <br> Whatever the reason, whatever the occasion, a bowl of this mac and cheese will always spell comfort. Here\u2019s the best, most classic recipe I know, with step-by-step pictures to guide you. <br> My mother was a bit of a rebel with her macaroni and cheese in that she didn\u2019t believe in making a <br>roux<br>. She always said she couldn\u2019t see what the fuss was about, and honestly, I\u2019m with her. For a simple weeknight meal, skip the roux. I find that the sauce thickens just fine without clumping if I just whisk a little flour with some of the milk before adding it to the pan. <br> When my brother and I were kids, we didn\u2019t like any \u201cstuff\u201d in our mac n\u2019 cheese. These days, I like a little more substance. <br>Ham<br> and peas are a favorite addition. Onions, red peppers, and sausage cooked with chili powder and cumin give a southwestern kick. Slow-cooked mushrooms and caramelized onions also make a bowl feel extra decadent. <br> As a bonafide roux-lover, I was skeptical of this recipe, but as a mom trying to quickly feed two little kids every night, I fell hard for this fuss-free technique. If you prefer a little bit looser cheese sauce, you can add up to another 1/4 cup of milk. Do this when you coat the pasta in the serving bowl, rather than while the sauce is simmering. <br> <br>\u2014<br>Meghan<br>, November 2017 <br> <br> This is a dish to fill you up and satisfy you to your toes, no matter how old you happen to be. How do you like your mac and cheese? ",

        "How To Roast a Turkey Upside Down",
        "<br> Roasting a large turkey for Thanksgiving is challenging for even the most seasoned home cooks. There are the logistics of <br>storing and thawing<br> a 10-plus-pound orb of frozen poultry and then figuring out the <br>per-pound math<br> for roasting your particular turkey. You also have two different meats \u2014 light, tender breast meat prone to overcooking, and dark meat that needs extra time. <br> A simple solution to that last obstacle? Flip the bird over and roast it breast-side down. While this technique won\u2019t give you a picture-perfect turkey, it will protect the white meat from drying out, while cooking the thigh meat faster. Roasting a turkey upside down is just as simple as it sounds. <br> Often the biggest complaint about turkey is that it\u2019s dry, but this method solves that problem. When roasted upside down, the turkey breast isn\u2019t directly exposed to the heat. In fact, being inverted means it\u2019s actually protected and insulated by the rest of the turkey. Instead, the dark meat is exposed with the thighs cooking faster in this position. <br> Having the thighs exposed over the breasts comes with a few added benefits. As the turkey roasts, the fatty dark meat of the thighs renders fat and juices that drip down onto the breast meat, slow-basting the bird through the whole cooking process. The thighs cook quicker when directly exposed to the heat and no basting means less time spent opening the oven. So beyond this ensuring juicier breast meat, you\u2019ll also find an upside-down turkey cooks a little faster. <br> Recipe-wise, this upside-down turkey isn\u2019t all that different from any roasted turkey recipe. You want to make sure the turkey is completely thawed the day of roasting. Remove the neck and giblets and liberally salt the turkey. I like to stuff my turkey with an onion, an apple, and some fresh herbs, but these are purely for the way they perfume the kitchen while roasting. Flip the turkey so it sits breast-side down in a roasting rack and set the rack in a roasting pan. Then roast the turkey. Start it in a hot oven to promote browning and then reduce the oven temperature and continue roasting until the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F. Here are a few tips for determining doneness for your turkey. <br> Some upside-down turkey recipes suggest turning the turkey over during the last 30 minutes of cooking to brown the breast skin, but having tried this, I don\u2019t think the risk of injury is worth the little browning that occurs in the last 30 minutes of roasting. If you really want a brown, crisped breast skin, rest the turkey, then flip and broil the turkey (or even just the breasts) for a few minutes under the broiler. <br> Rest the turkey upside down for 25 to 30 minutes before carving. Remove the roasting rack to a cutting board or baking sheet to rest while you <br>make gravy<br> with the roasting pan juices. Remove the thighs while the turkey is still breast-side down. Then flip to remove the drumsticks and breasts. ",

        "How To Brine a Turkey",
        "<br> If you boldly volunteered to roast the Thanksgiving turkey this year and are starting to feel your first nervous twinges, I have three words of advice: Brine your bird. Brining is your ticket to a juicy, full-flavored turkey, even if you\u2019re not feeling totally confident about your roasting skills. Today, I\u2019ll explain why this works and show you exactly what you need to do. <br> Turkey is a relatively lean bird, particularly the breast meat, meaning that it doesn\u2019t have a lot of fat to help keep the meat from becoming dry and tough. It needs some help if we want to avoid the kind of turkey situation that makes us sad and mopey on Thanksgiving. <br> This is where brining comes in. A brine is a very basic solution of water and salt, and by giving our turkey a long and luxurious dunk in this solution, we can actually coax a bit more moisture and flavor into our meal. <br> During brining, the turkey absorbs extra moisture, which in turn helps it stay more moist and juicy both during and after cooking. Since the turkey absorbs salt along with the water, it also gets nicely seasoned from the inside out. Even better, the salt breaks down some of the turkey\u2019s muscle proteins, which helps with the overall moisture absorption and also prevents the meat from toughing up quite so much during cooking. <br> If you\u2019re nervous about overcooking your turkey and winding up with a platter of dry turkey meat on your table, think of brining as your insurance. A brined bird will stay juicy and taste good even if you overshoot the cooking time a little, and that\u2019s one less thing you need to worry about during your holiday meal. <br> One downside to brining a turkey is that it takes up a good amount of fridge real-estate. First, find a pot or bucket big enough to comfortably hold the turkey and keep it fully submerged. Next, work your Tetris skills and rearrange the fridge to make enough space. If you\u2019re okay meeting these two conditions, then we\u2019re in business. <br> I don\u2019t recommend brining your turkey in a cooler since it\u2019s hard to be totally sure that the turkey says safely below 40\u00b0F the whole time. However, if you\u2019re short on fridge space, an empty refrigerator crisper drawer makes a surprisingly good brining container. You might also consider dry-brining your turkey, which requires less fridge space and also results in a juicy, well-seasoned turkey. <br> Brine only turkeys that have not been pre-treated in any way, which should be clearly stated on the label. Do not use turkeys labeled as \u201ckosher,\u201d \u201cenhanced,\u201d or \u201cself-basting\u201d for brining. These turkeys have already been enhanced with salt in some way and brining would result in an over-salted turkey. If your label doesn\u2019t say any of these things or give any indication that it has been pre-treated, then it\u2019s safe to assume you\u2019re getting the turkey and nothing but the turkey, and you\u2019re clear to proceed with brining. <br> It\u2019s fine to brine a partially thawed turkey. The thawing process will continue while the turkey is in the brine. <br> Cook a brined turkey just as you normally would. Once it\u2019s out of the brine, pat it dry and rub it with any spices you were planning to use (although you can skip the salt!). You can also baste the turkey with juices or brush it with butter as it roasts. <br> I\u2019ve found that brined turkeys tend to cook a little more quickly than un-brined turkeys, so I recommend starting to check the internal temperature of your turkey about an hour before the predicted cooking time is over. Once your turkey registers above 165\u00b0F in the breast meat and thighs, then it\u2019s done. ",

        "<br> If you love pumpkin pie and just can\u2019t wait until Thanksgiving dinner to taste your first slice, then I have a dessert for you. This is a little cup of pumpkin pie, mug cake-style, with a gingersnap crust and snappy spices, and it feeds just one person: you. Make it in a mug, in the microwave, and you can be eating pumpkin pie 10 minutes from right now. <br> Yes, this is a mug pie (not to be confused with a <br>mudpie<br>) but it falls somewhere between a pie and a cake in texture. It\u2019s a little treat for those of you who adore pumpkin and spiced fall desserts, and it\u2019s a quick and easy way to give yourself a sweet ending to a long day without baking an entire pie. Like other mug cakes baked in the microwave, its texture is soft and a little spongy. There\u2019s a satisfying base of gingersnap crumbs in butter, too; they don\u2019t crisp up like they would in the oven but I love the way they complement the taste of the pumpkin. <br> The pumpkin comes through boldly; if you have homemade squash puree laying about this is a great use for it. I sweeten it up with brown sugar and spice it with pumpkin pie spice, but feel free to substitute honey, maple syrup, or other sweeteners, and to use your own mixes of spices instead of a packaged pumpkin pie spice.

        "How To Make Turkey Gravy",
        "<br> You\u2019ve roasted your turkey, and now it\u2019s time for gravy. You don\u2019t need a recipe; this step-by-step guide will show you how to make delicious gravy to pour over your mashed potatoes and turkey with wild abandon. <br> The deeply browned and rich scrapings from the bottom of the roasting pan might not look like much when you first take the turkey out of the oven, but those drippings are Thanksgiving manna. Let\u2019s make some gravy. <br> There are many wonderful ways you can make gravy. You can make it <br>with giblets<br> or you can make it <br>just with broth<br>. You can even make it <br>weeks ahead of time<br> to save yourself some kitchen frenzy on Thanksgiving day. <br> My favorite is a plain, old-fashioned gravy from the pan drippings made just seconds before setting all the food on the table. This makes for a deeply flavorful gravy that enhances everything on the plate with a touch of savory goodness. <br> It\u2019s also one of the easiest gravies to make, in my opinion. From roux to table, it takes about five minutes and requires only a pan and a whisk. That\u2019s something we can handle even after a long day of cooking with the promise of dinner only moments away. <br> Roux is a combination of fat \u2014 pan drippings, butter, or oil \u2014 and flour cooked together and used to thicken everything from gravy to b\u00e9chamel sauce. Here are a few things you should know about making roux for better gravy. <br> <br>Read more:<br> <br>How To Make a Roux<br> ",

        "<br> This recipe from my new cookbook, <br>Not Your Mother\u2019s Casseroles<br>, is perhaps the perfect expression of what I love about casseroles. It\u2019s quick and easy \u2014 a modern, lightened-up version of a \u201cdump-and-mix\u201d dish, where you open up a few cans and mix everything together. But it also has fresh flavors, lighter dairy, and \u2014 the best part \u2014 no pasta. Instead, protein-rich, toothsome chickpeas take center stage. <br> This is a meatless vegetarian dish, bright with lemon zest and herbs. It gets finished off with a crunchy, olive oil-drizzled crust of Parmesan and breadcrumbs. It\u2019s creamy inside, crisp on top. But it leaves out old-fashioned canned soups and all those heaps of cheese and cream. Instead I use some low-fat yogurt (so tasty and tangy!) and some cottage cheese to bind the casserole together. <br> I also love how pretty this casserole is when served up. When you scoop up this casserole you see the pink shallots, the green flecks of herbs, and of course the golden creaminess of cheese and chickpeas. <br> This reheats beautifully. It is often my go-to lunch, and I love it with a good green salad and some crisp white wine for dinner too. It\u2019s very satisfying \u2014 those chickpeas make for a more filling meal than pasta or rice. <br> I haven\u2019t frozen this particular dish, but I have no reason to think that it wouldn\u2019t freeze well. <br> This is my favorite kind of casserole! It\u2019s the ideal balance between hearty and comforting and wholesome and light. In testing it again though, I find myself wishing the center of the casserole was a touch creamier. This sentiment was echoed by some of you in the comments, who felt the casserole was on the dry side. <br> We made a slight tweak to the recipe, calling for a little extra yogurt plus some broth, which prevents dryness and makes for a creamier casserole. It\u2019s a small change, and makes a big difference without significantly changing the casserole. So if you\u2019ve made it before and loved it, this will still give you the same wholesome, hearty result. <br> <br> \u2014 <br>Kelli<br>, November 2018 <br> ",

        "How To Make Scalloped Potatoes",
        "<br> You know you\u2019ve got yourself a party when the scalloped potatoes show up at the table. With its layers of cream and potatoes, and then more cream and more potatoes, all baked until bubbly \u2014 well, I would be hard-pressed to think of another dish that pairs comfort and elegance quite so perfectly. Here\u2019s how to make this classic dish for your next dinner party. <br> Think scalloped potatoes and gratins are one and the same? Not so fast, my friend! Both are made with thinly sliced potatoes cooked in cream, but they have one small, but significant, difference: cheese. Classic scalloped potatoes are made with just cream and potatoes, while gratins add cheese between those layers and over the top. <br> These two dishes have gotten pretty scrambled together over the years (because who doesn\u2019t love cheese with their creamy potatoes?), but today we\u2019re focusing on the classic scalloped potato dish. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 if you want to add cheese to your version, that\u2019s totally fine by us. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>What\u2019s the Difference Between Scalloped and Au Gratin Potatoes?<br> <br> You want starchy potatoes for this dish \u2014 it\u2019s that starch that helps the cream thicken up into a velvety sauce during cooking. Go for Russet potatoes or Yukon Golds. Russets have the most starch and make the creamiest sauce, but Yukons tend to hold their shape a little better (although your sauce will be slightly more milky). <br> Cut the potatoes to between 1/8- and 1/4-inch thick. A <br>mandoline<br> makes this very quick and easy, but you can also do this with a sharp chef\u2019s knife. Just make sure your slices are all roughly the same thickness so they cook at the same rate. <br> I like to simmer the sliced potatoes in the cream for a few minutes before layering everything in the dish. This gets all the ingredients warmed up to the same temperature, which cuts down on the total cooking time. You\u2019re not actually cooking the potatoes through at this point; once your cream starts to simmer, you\u2019re ready to go. <br> The potatoes won\u2019t all be submerged in the cream, so gently move them around with tongs during this step so they warm evenly. <br> This dish is more about potatoes cooked in cream rather than a firmly set casserole, so the sauce might still be fairly loose and liquidy even once the dish is bubbling and the potatoes are tender. This is all fine \u2014 nothing about potatoes cooked in cream is really a bad thing, in my opinion. <br> Use a slotted spoon or a <br>fish spatula<br> to serve so that you can lift the stacked layers and serve the potatoes in squares or wedges. Scoop out some of that creamy sauce left in the pan and drizzle it over the top. Leftovers are very good reheated. <br> Although I\u2019d rather not admit it, I actually grew up with boxed scalloped potatoes and didn\u2019t taste the homemade version until way too late in life. I am happy to report this recipe is helping me make up for lost time. It\u2019s as tried and true as it gets, and so creamy and decadent. As the weather begins to cool down, this is the perfect side dish to turn to. Of course, it\u2019s also a classic choice once Thanksgiving prep gets underway. <br> <br>\u2014 <br>Sheela<br>, September 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Honey-Glazed Ham in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> My father in-law is not a big fan of turkey and makes his love of ham at the holidays well-known. Honestly, I can relate. After spending much of the summer and fall testing turkey recipes, I\u2019m ready for something different come November. So we started adding a ham to the family Thanksgiving menu about five years ago, but as the host (and cook), I ran into a problem: How can I season and heat a ham while the turkey is hogging all the oven time? Slow cooker ham is the solution! <br> Since most holiday hams come fully baked, all I have to do is load it into the slow cooker in the morning to have ham in time for lunch. As another bonus? The slow cooker can be set to warm, so the ham stays moist while we wait for that one sister-in-law who is always late. <br> Spiral-cut ham isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve always loved. The glaze can be overly sweet, and the texture of the meat can be unpleasantly chewy. This recipe avoids both pitfalls with a custom not-too-sweet glaze and a slow cooker method. The low, slow heat of the slow cooker gently braises the ham, making it the most tender you\u2019ll ever eat. <br> Beyond how much better a slow cooker ham is than an oven-baked ham, cooking the ham in the slow cooker eliminates some of the challenges of serving a ham alongside your Thanksgiving turkey or holiday roast. <br> Whole spiral-cut hams are most famously known from the Honey Baked Hams brand, but this type of ham can also be found in almost every major grocery store or at your local butcher. City hams, as they are also known, are a leg of pork that\u2019s cured and sometimes smoked before being cooked and spiral-cut. <br> Look for a spiral-cut ham that is fully cooked (it must be labeled as such) and has the bone in. Butt-end hams tend to fit into slow cookers more readily, but their bone is a little trickier to slice around. Consider the size of your slow cooker when shopping for your ham. A 10-pound ham is as big as you can go for a six-quart slow cooker. <br> <br>Learn more: <br>A Complete Guide to Buying Holiday Ham<br> <br> The glaze is an opportunity to add considerable flavor and texture to the ham, so we suggest making your own. I find a mixture of brown sugar, honey, mustard, and cloves hits all the sweet, warm, and tangy flavors that are familiar and comforting on ham. Plus, these ingredients thicken as they cook, making a sticky-sweet sauce to spoon over the slices when serving. <br> <br>What about the glaze packet? <br>Most fully cooked hams also come with a packet of glaze mix that is essentially brown sugar and spices, which you add water to. There is nothing really wrong with this glaze mix, and you can in fact use it to cook your ham with the following method too. <br> <br>Want to try something different?<br> <br>5 Easy, 3-Ingredient Glazes for Ham<br> ",

        "How To Cook a Turkey: The Simplest, Easiest Method",
        "<br> Are you roasting a whole turkey for the holidays for the first time this year? Want the easiest, simplest method? Or perhaps you\u2019ve done this many times before, but you want a quick refresher to brush up on the basics? We\u2019ll help you make your mama proud with these step-by-step instructions for roasting a whole turkey. <br> Here is our super basic, super simple, super easy recipe for roasting a super beautiful turkey this Thanksgiving. <br> Now, we know that many people have strong opinions on the best way to cook a turkey. You may fry it, grill it, roast it overnight, or even cook it in a slow cooker. You may brine religiously every year, or maybe have a secret family spice rub that only gets used at Thanksgiving. <br> But just to keep things really simple and straightforward with this tutorial, today we are taking a completely no-frills approach \u2014 though there are lots of places along the way where you can add some spice, extra flavor, or personal touches. <br> Consider this a recipe template and feel free to play with it as much or as little as you like; our goal is simply to give you a foolproof way to get that turkey roasted and onto plates with as little stress as possible. <br> This method will work with any turkey: big or small, brined or not, free-range or otherwise. Cooking times will vary, but the basic technique will be the same. For reference, the turkey in the photos was a pre-brined 16-pound turkey <br>from Williams-Sonoma<br>. <br> For this method, be sure to let your turkey completely thaw before cooking. If it was frozen through when you bought it, the turkey will thaw within a few days in the fridge, approximately <br>24 hours for every five pounds of turkey<br>. For quicker thawing, place the turkey in a cold water bath and change the water every 30 minutes until it\u2019s thawed. <br> For more information on safe turkey thawing, check out the USDA website and our detailed turkey thawing instructions. <br> However, if your turkey isn\u2019t completely thawed yet \u2014 no worries! You can roast your frozen turkey and it will turn out just fine! If your turkey is still frozen \u2014 fully or partially \u2014 just hop on over to our frozen turkey tutorial and follow the instructions. You\u2019ll be fine (and your gravy will be even more delicious). <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>How To Cook a Frozen Turkey<br> <br> One thing we\u2019re <br>not<br> talking about here is brining the turkey. This method has become popular over the last few years and involves immersing the turkey in a salt-water solution or dry-brining in salt for a day or so before cooking. The end result of this process is moist, perfectly seasoned white and dark meat. We\u2019ve had great results with brining and heartily endorse it. If you want to brine, great! If you don\u2019t, our method here will still work perfectly. <br> For more details on how to brine your own turkey, check out these posts: <br> After roasting the turkey should rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. This is the perfect time to make gravy for serving along side your lovely roast bird. Move the turkey to a cutting board and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. This way you can use all those tasty pan drippings for gravy making. <br> Carving a turkey is just like carving an extra-large chicken. Make sure your chef\u2019s knife is sharp and then go for it. Remove the wings first, and then the thighs \u2014 pop out the joints that keep these pieces attached to the bird and cut straight through the joint. When carving the beast meat, slice close to the rib cage with the flat of your knife right up against the rib bones. Once you have the meat off, you can separate the thighs into thighs and drumsticks, and carve the breast meat into individual slices. <br> <br>Read more:<br>How To Carve a Turkey: The Simplest, Easiest Method<br> <br> Are you ready? Let\u2019s cook some turkey! If you get anxious during roasting, just remember that roasting a turkey is <br>just like roasting a large chicken<br>. The same methods and ideas apply. Even if you don\u2019t get fancy with spices or brining or special basting liquids, your turkey will still turn out browned, moist, and flavorful. <br> Please share your own stories, advice, and recipe suggestions in the comments below!

Check the temperature in three places: the breast, outer thigh, and inside thigh (see photos above). In every case, the meat should be at least 165\u00b0F when the turkey has finished cooking. If any place is under that temperature, put the turkey back in the oven for another 20 minutes. Shield the breast meat with foil if needed to keep it from overcooking.",
            "Rest the turkey before carving.",
            " Remove the turkey from the oven. Grab one side of the roasting rack with an oven mitt and tilt the whole pan so the liquids inside the turkey cavity run out into the pan. (These juices are used to make the gravy.) Then, lift the whole turkey (still on the rack) and transfer it to a clean cutting board.

        "How To Dry-Brine a Turkey",
        "<br> We\u2019re heading into Thanksgiving turkey season, and perhaps you\u2019re already researching how to cook that big, intimidating piece of poultry. There are questions that immediately emerge: How much turkey should I buy? What\u2019s the best way to cook it? Should I brine the bird? <br> Brining will help you cook the most succulent turkey you\u2019ve ever had \u2014 and the smartest, easiest way to do it is with a <br>dry brine<br>. Even if you\u2019re hosting Thanksgiving for the first time and are a bit nervous about cooking your inaugural turkey, here\u2019s how to dry-brine your turkey like a pro and turn out an impeccably juicy, delicious bird. <br> When you\u2019re dealing with a large piece of lean meat like a whole turkey, it\u2019s easy to overcook it into a dry, unappealing texture. Also, just seasoning it right before cooking means there\u2019s no time for the salt to penetrate into the meat, especially for thick cuts. <br> Brining, or soaking a piece of meat in salty seasoned water, is a way to inject both flavor and moisture at the same time. <br> <br>More on brining:<br> <br>How To Brine Any Meat <br> <br> <br> A <br>dry brine<br>, also called pre-salting, seasons the turkey like a more traditional wet brine, but it does not use any water. Instead, a dry brine involves rubbing the salt, seasonings, and/or sugar directly onto the meat and skin, and then letting the meat rest in the refrigerator for a period of time before cooking. <br> What happens during this time is really interesting: First, the salt draws out the meat juices through osmosis. Next, the salt dissolves into the juices, essentially turning into a \u201cnatural\u201d brine even though there isn\u2019t any added liquid. And finally, this brine is reabsorbed into the meat and starts breaking down tough muscle proteins, resulting in juicy, tender, seasoned meat. <br> The larger the piece of meat, the more time is needed for the brine to be effective. This method was made popular by chef Judy Rodgers, who dry-brined her famous roast chicken at San Francisco\u2019s Zuni Cafe. <br> Now that we know what dry-brining is, what are its advantages, especially when cooking a Thanksgiving turkey? <br> When starting on this magical adventure of dry-brining, here are a couple of things to know. <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the home?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> ",

        "How To Cook Turkey Breast",
        "<br> Are you hosting a smaller get together for Easter, Thanksgiving, or Christmas this year? Don\u2019t bother with a whole turkey \u2014 just roast a turkey breast! One half-breast or even a whole turkey breast makes more than enough for a small party of four to six. (And yes, you\u2019ll still have plenty of pan drippings to make gravy.) <br> Turkey breasts are also a cinch to roast \u2014 no flipping, no basting, no fuss. Here\u2019s a recipe to show you how to do it, step by step. <br> A small-scale Thanksgiving isn\u2019t the only reason why you might think about roasting a turkey breast on its own. Here are a few more times when turkey breast is a good idea. <br> Most grocery stores sell turkey breasts year-round. You\u2019ll either find them in the chest coolers or in the butcher\u2019s display case. For this method, buy <br>bone-in and skin-on breasts.<br> <br> One (three-pound) half-breast will feed two to four people. A whole (six- to seven-pound) turkey breast (two breasts, still joined at the breast bone) will feed six to eight people. This method here will work for either amount of meat. <br> Make sure your turkey breast is thawed before roasting. Generally, a totally frozen turkey breast will thaw in about 24 hours in the fridge. Once thawed, the turkey can be kept refrigerated for several days before roasting. <br> Turkey breasts can also be <br>dry-brined<br> or <br>wet-brined<br>, just like turkey. Be sure to start either of these methods the day before you plan to cook. <br> I cook turkey breasts almost exactly the same way that I cook a whole turkey: I start it in a hot 450\u00b0F oven to start the browning and then turn down the heat to 350\u00b0F so that the breast meat cooks through slowly. The turkey breast on its own will usually cook more quickly than the whole turkey, so start checking it after an hour and continue roasting until it registers 165\u00b0F in the thickest part of the meat. Because it\u2019s quicker to cook, I also don\u2019t bother with basting. <br> I also roast a turkey breast on a roasting rack in a roasting pan to elevate it off the bottom of the pan. But because a turkey breast is smaller, you don\u2019t necessarily have to use a roasting pan. You can also use an oven-safe skillet or any baking dish that will hold the breasts. Instead of a roasting rack, you can roast the turkey breast over thick-cut onions and potatoes (instant side dish!). <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the home?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> ",

        "How To Make Whipped Cream",
        "<br> I admit to being a bit fanatical about whipped cream. There\u2019s just no way I\u2019d make a beautiful homemade pie or any other dessert and then top it off with whipped cream from a can! Especially not when making whipped cream from scratch is so very easy and so <br>very <br>much better. <br> Whipping cream is special in that it can go from puddle of milk to a bowl of billowy, sweet-tasting clouds in a matter of minutes. It\u2019s the cream\u2019s milkfat content that makes this possible. As you whisk the milk, the fat molecules start to join together and <br>form pockets of air<br>, gradually making a stable structure \u2014 whipped cream. (And if you whip too long, you can actually break the fat apart again and <br>make butter<br>!) <br> What is labeled \u201cwhipping cream\u201d at the store usually has a milkfat content of 30% to 35%. Heavy cream actually has a slightly higher milkfat content (around 36%) so you can use it to make whipped cream as well. But don\u2019t try making whipped cream with any other kinds of milk \u2014 the milkfat content just isn\u2019t high enough to whip into whipped cream. There\u2019s no such thing as low-fat whipped cream in the real world, unfortunately for those of us who love it. <br> You can make whipped cream in a stand mixer, with a hand mixer, or by good ol\u2019 muscle power with a whisk and a bowl. Keep the cream refrigerated right up until you\u2019re ready to whip it so that it\u2019s as cold as possible. If it\u2019s a hot day, chilling your bowl and whisk also help. If you\u2019re using a stand mixer or hand mixer, keep an eye on your speed. It\u2019s tempting to go fast, but keeping the speed between medium and medium-high helps make sure you don\u2019t overshoot that perfect soft billowy stage and start going grainy. I usually aim for \u201cfirm peaks\u201d with my whipped cream, which is when the cream holds peaks but the tips are slightly softened. Much beyond this stage and I find the cream starts becoming overly stiff and somewhat grainy. <br> Whipped cream is at its best right after you whip it. It only takes about 5 minutes to make, so this is one task I often leave until the very last minute. This said, whipped cream will hold for a few hours in the refrigerator \u2014 give it a few sturdy whips with a whisk to froth it back up into full glory before serving. ",

        "How To Make Bread Stuffing (Dressing) for Thanksgiving",
        "<br> Anyone else here think that the stuffing is the best part of Thanksgiving dinner? I love its mix of textures and flavors \u2014 crunchy roasted nuts with soft broth-soaked bread and chewy morsels of spiced sausage. Oh <br>mama<br>, that\u2019s good stuff! As the self-designated stuffing-maker in our house, I\u2019ve tweaked and tested my recipe over the years until finally settling on this one easy method. <br> I find that the key to good stuffing is twofold: the proportion of ingredients and the amount of stock used to soak the bread. With the ingredients, you want a little taste of each thing every few bites. For me, this means a healthy cup or so each of nuts, sausage, vegetables, and fruit. The bread binds everything together, so I always pick a good one. Sourdough is my favorite, though one year I used <br>pumpkin bread<br> for a fantastic sweet-savory twist. <br> I always bake my stuffing separately from the turkey, opting for more control over the cooking rather than tradition. I also like my stuffing fairly moist, <br>like a panade<br>, so I add enough broth to come about 3/4 up the side of the baking dish \u2014 this is roughly 3 to 4 cups when baking in a 3-quart casserole dish. If you don\u2019t like your stuffing quite so saturated, use less stock. <br> A few other tricks for great stuffing? Toast the bread until it\u2019s completely dry; this helps it to absorb the stock and also hold its shape during cooking. Toast the nuts while you\u2019re at it. If you don\u2019t like fruit in your stuffing, add extra vegetables instead. You can toast the bread and cook the sausage filling the day ahead to save yourself some time on Thanksgiving, but wait to mix it with the egg or stock until just before cooking. <br> <br> How do you like your stuffing? Have your own tips or suggestions to share?<br> <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

        "How To Cook Scallops on the Stovetop",
        "<br> Scallops are a little luxury in my household. A weekend date night means plates of pasta and scallops with wedges of lemon and glasses of white wine on the side. Scallops are sustainable, delicious, and so easy! Here\u2019s how to make quick-cooking scallops on the stovetop in just about five minutes. <br> Scallops are not inexpensive (in my area they go for at least $20 a pound), so it can be a little intimidating to cook them.<br> What if you mess up such an expensive dinner?<br> <br> This is the beautiful thing about scallops, though; once you understand how quickly they are cooked, you\u2019ll never mess them up. They take just four to five minutes to cook \u2014 that\u2019s it! We\u2019ll show you below, step by step, how to do this, but the gist is simple: Sear in an oiled skillet for about two minutes on each side. Done! <br> Scallops are almost always a sustainable choice in seafood; they\u2019re a safe option in terms of sustainability. <br> <br>Read more: <br>Love Scallops? Lucky You. They\u2019re a Great Sustainable Seafood Choice.<br> <br> Scallops\u2019 quick-cooking properties also mean that you should have everything else for your meal ready to go before putting them in the pan. Scallops are the last thing to go on the plate, so have your pasta, sauce, or salad ready and waiting before you cook the scallops. <br> One of my favorite meals is scallops on top of some creamy pur\u00e9ed vegetables. I\u2019ll cook cauliflower or rutabaga, pur\u00e9e it until silky-smooth, and keep it warm in a covered bowl. I\u2019ll make a tossed salad, set out warmed plates, and pour the wine. Then, at the last minute, with the table set and candles lit, I\u2019ll quickly cook the scallops and plate it all up. They\u2019re such a treat \u2014 one of the easiest, nicest meals you can eat at home. <br> While there are plenty of recipes out there with scallops, think of them as a protein addition to nearly any favorite recipe. Sear them according to this method and then plop them on top of pasta dressed with olive oil and lemon, or on your favorite couscous recipe. (They would be delicious on <br>cauliflower couscous<br>!)

        "How To Make Mashed Potatoes in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> Mashed potatoes are a requirement on the Thanksgiving table, and a hearty side dish for any meal throughout the fall and winter. But they do require some labor \u2014 peeling, chopping, boiling, mashing. One of my favorite Thanksgiving tips is to do all this labor ahead and <br>keep the potatoes warm<br> for hours in the Crock-Pot. <br> But then it hit me: Why not use the slow cooker from start to finish? Could you take half the labor out of mashed potatoes? Turns out, you can \u2014 and guess what? I\u2019m never going back. Here\u2019s a step-by-step recipe for the <br>best<br> mashed potatoes, made from start to finish in the slow cooker. <br> The slow cooker, it turns out, is the magic pot when it comes to mashed potatoes. Here\u2019s how it works: Just cut up your potatoes after peeling them (if you like them peeled!) and put them in a slow cooker with a small amount of liquid. <br> <br>Remember! <br>Here\u2019s Why You Should Never Throw Out Potato Peels <br> <br> Cover and cook until they\u2019re very tender, then mash them right in the pot and stir in milk and butter. Put the lid back on and turn the slow cooker to warm, and your potatoes are ready whenever you are. <br> No big pot for boiling water or steaming the potatoes, and the whole thing is much more hands-off. <br> From now on, this is how I\u2019m doing this on Thanksgiving morning. I\u2019ll start my potatoes first thing, right after breakfast, and then mash whenever I have a spare minute in the afternoon. <br> The timeline is so much more forgiving; you don\u2019t have to remember to start water boiling or align your schedule to when the potatoes should be made. <br> Depending on how long you cook the mashed potatoes, the milk will probably begin to caramelize and brown around the edges of the pot, the way it does on top of a baked potato gratin. I scraped away this browned milk, but you can also leave it in (it\u2019s actually quite delicious; it just changes the color, and not everyone wants little brown specks in their potatoes!). <br> You could also probably cook the potatoes overnight on LOW, but I did not test this. On all of my testing runs I cooked the potatoes on HIGH for about four hours. I had the best final result when the potatoes <br>really <br>got soft and fell apart; don\u2019t skimp on the cooking time. <br> The final recipe here, too, is one for rich, creamy, holiday-style mashed potatoes. But you don\u2019t have to add the butter and milk; you can of course just use the basic method and mash up the plain potatoes for a lighter dish. ",

        "Recipe: Smoky Sweet Potato & Black Bean Casserole",
        "<br> The middle of the winter season calls for comforting casseroles that don\u2019t skimp on flavor. This gluten-free, vegetarian casserole uses both smoked mozzarella cheese and smoky paprika to liven up sweet potatoes and black beans, and it\u2019s hearty enough to serve as a main or side dish. <br> As much as I wished that I could just stir all the ingredients together and throw the ingredients into the oven, the raw onions never quite softened up even after a long bake time. Instead, a quick saut\u00e9 did the trick to make them tender and sweet. <br> While you might think that the dish then takes longer to put together, the onions cook in about the same amount of time it takes to peel and dice the sweet potatoes, so get those started first while you prep everything else and you\u2019ll be fine. <br> Canned black beans and drained canned tomatoes join the sweet potatoes and onions for the base, but the crowning finish to this casserole is a blanket of smoky, melted mozzarella cheese. It\u2019s worth it to seek out this cheese \u2014 and don\u2019t be tempted to use smoked Gouda, which is drier and doesn\u2019t melt as nicely. ",

        "<br> Carrot halwa, also known as <br>gajar ka halwa<br>, is an unusual Indian dessert. It\u2019s made with grated carrots, whole milk, dried fruit, and nuts, and it has a delicious light fudgy texture. Traditionally served at Indian festivals and in temples, this classic dessert is a favorite in Indian households during Diwali, the festival of lights, which is this week! <br> Diwali \u2014 the festival of lights \u2014 is one of the best-known Indian festivals. One of the traditional legends behind the festival involves the Hindu God, Rama, who was exiled with his wife and brother by his father\u2019s jealous wife. During his exile, his wife, Sita, was kidnapped by the king Ravana, which led to an epic battle to free her. After Rama\u2019s fourteen years of exile were up, he returned to Ayodhya, his hometown, where people lined the streets with oil lamps to light his way and celebrate his return. There are also other legends that swirl around Diwali, with each region of India telling its own story. <br> Diwali is a Hindu festival, but Indians of all religions celebrate the day. Small <br>diyas<br> (little oil lamps) adorn the door steps in the country, and every home is decorated with colorful flowers and sparkling lights. Fireworks burst throughout the night and people in their finest clothes celebrate with family and friends \u2014 and throng the streets! People give gifts of clothes and trinkets to family and friends, and take all sorts of sweets to each other\u2019s homes, like <br>gulab jamun<br> <br>(deep-fried dough soaked in sugar syrup), <br>rasagulla<br> (paneer balls in sugar syrup), <br>laddoos<br> (sweet dough rounds), and of course, halwa. <br> Diwali is one of those festivals that transcends religion and brings people together. It celebrates the triumph of good over evil and is a great way of celebrating the diversity of the Indian subcontinent and its diaspora. ",

        "<br> When it comes to food for a celebration, you can either go for the full dinner or opt for bites and nibbles to power you all night long. Now, the nice thing about the bites and nibbles option is you get to nosh on those bites and nibbles all night long. And no food lends itself more to such a notion like a well-made samosa. <br> These samosas were one of the first items Atlanta-based chef Asha Gomez created for her daytime dining spot, <br>Spice To Table<br>, and the first thing that appeared on our South Indian New Year\u2019s Eve menu (although you can make them any time of year). Unlike traditional samosas, they\u2019re made with puff pastry for a buttery, flaky crunch, although the filling is very much full of South Indian ingredients and flavors. As Asha likes to say, \u201cThis is about an evolution of flavor, not a fusion.\u201d <br> The beauty of samosas is their versatility, so take advantage of all that they offer. Asha shared three fillings for samosas and we were hard-pressed to say yes to just one, so it\u2019s three you get instead. Hooray! <br> While any of the fillings listed above make a three-bite snack anyone would be glad to partake in, you can certainly use your own favorite filling in these samosas. To keep this in the same school of flavor as the other items on this menu, try to incorporate the garam masala mixture into your filling. <br> The exact ratios and ingredients of <br>garam masala <br>change from brand to brand and household to household, so find something you like and experiment from there. Regardless of the combination you arrive at, garam masala will always do its job of adding warmth and depth to whatever it\u2019s added to. <br> We\u2019re ringing in the new year with a burst of flavor and color and a menu from Asha Gomez\u2019s celebrated cookbook,<br> My Two Souths<br>. Inspired by the parallel flavors of home in Kerala and her home in Atlanta, Asha creates recipes that tell the stories of how these two cultures and traditions of cooking overlap to create the food she shares in her Atlanta-based Indian p\u00e2tisserie, <br>Spice To Table<br>.

        "Recipe: Apple Pie Breakfast Cookies",
        "<br> I have long been a fan of the breakfast cookie (or any cookie, really). Many of us enjoy scones or muffins for breakfast, so why not a very near cousin made more morning-appropriate thanks to whole-grain flour and natural sugar? I\u2019ve done many riffs on this recipe; this one is warmly spiced and tailored for crisp, cozy fall mornings. <br> I did a version of a breakfast cookie in my cookbook, <br>Whole Grain Mornings<br>, that was really loaded with nuts and had millet for extra crunch. I used that recipe to come up with this new version, packed with fragrant apples, soft raisins, and toasty pecans. <br> The first time I baked up a batch, the apples weren\u2019t fully cooked; and while the cookie itself tasted delicious, I wished the apples were softer and more integrated. So this time, I cooked them down with a little brown sugar and lemon juice until they were soft and resembled apple pie filling. Then I folded them in towards the end to give the dough great flavor and texture. <br> The dough for these cookies is definitely on the wetter side, so never fear if you feel you did something wrong: you likely didn\u2019t. They also don\u2019t spread much on the cookie sheet, so feel free to place them relatively close together. <br> These cookies freeze beautifully and are easily adaptable (use your favorite nuts and fruit instead if you\u2019d like). If you make any adaptations or changes that you\u2019re particularly excited about, I\u2019d love to hear about them! ",

        "Recipe: Baked Apples Stuffed with Oatmeal & Brown Sugar",
        "<br> If I\u2019m not feeling like making something elaborate and just want an easy, warm dessert to end an evening, this is where I turn: baked apples. Scoop out the core and stuff the insides with a mix of oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The baked apples soften into a spoonable treat while the brown sugar melts down into a caramel syrup. <br> The only thing that could make this simple autumn dessert even better would be a scoop of ice cream on the side. Naturally. <br> My mom made this dessert all the time when we were kids, and we loved it. Besides the straight-up oatmeal and brown sugar mix, she would sometimes add nuts, raisins, or even a scoop of cream cheese or peanut butter as an extra-special treat. For my brother and me, this was the most decadent treat imaginable; while I\u2019m sure my parents loved having a fairly wholesome dessert with which to satisfy their sugar-loving children. <br> I appreciate this dessert even more now that I\u2019m grown. It still satisfies a weeknight craving for something warm and sweet, but I\u2019ve also made a double batch for an easy dinner party dessert. Dressed up with a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce, baked apples are a crowd-pleaser \u2014 and it\u2019s a good one to have in your back pocket for gluten-free and vegan guests, too. <br> P.S. Any leftover apples make a fantastic breakfast the next day. I should know \u2014 I\u2019ve eaten enough of them! ",

        "How To Roast Beets in the Oven",
        "<br> Roasted beets are a year-round staple in our house; they\u2019re fantastic for tossing in salads, quick pickling, or making into fritters. We roast several at once by wrapping them in foil and tucking them into the oven to cook alongside braises, bread, or whatever else we might be cooking. Then the beets are ready for whenever we need them. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide for roasting perfectly tender beets every time. <br> Beets don\u2019t <br>have<br> to be roasted, and are actually quite good thinly sliced and eaten raw. But roasting transforms beets from something crunchy into something silky and tender. Although it requires a hot oven, I prefer roasting over boiling or steaming because roasting concentrates the beet\u2019s flavors and brings out its sweeter side. <br> This roasting method works for any kind and any size of beet. Pick beets that feel hard in your hand, never soft or squishy. If you have the choice, pick bunches with their big leaves still attached. Those greens wilt down beautifully and can be added to stir-fries, frittatas, pasta dishes, or anywhere else a little extra green might be welcome. <br> Once roasted, beets will keep refrigerated for up to a week. I keep them in one big container and slice off just what I need for whatever I\u2019m making. <br> <br> What are your favorite ways to use roasted beets?<br> ",

This is a flexible cooking temperature; if you're using the oven for cooking something else, beets can be cooked at that temperature. Beets will cook more slowly at lower temperature and more quickly at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, check more frequently for scorching (see Step 3).",
            "Prepare the beets.",
            " If the beets still have their leafy tops, cut off the tops close to the tops of the beet, leaving yourself enough to grip. Save the beet greens for another purpose. Scrub the beets thoroughly, then wrap them loosely in aluminum foil. No need to dry the beets before wrapping. Small beets can be wrapped together, but it's easiest to roast large beets individually.",
            "Roast the beets.",
            " Place the wrapped beets on a rimmed baking sheet to catch drips in case the beet juices leak. Roast for 50 to 60 minutes. Check the beets every 20 minutes or so. If they are starting to look dry or are scorching on the bottoms, dribble a tablespoon of water over the beets before re-wrapping. Beets are done when a fork or skewer slides easily to the center of the beet. Small beets will cook more quickly than large beets.",

        "Halloween Recipe: Candy-Coated Marshmallow Spiders",
        "<br> Boo! Spiders are taking over this Halloween! Don\u2019t be scared, these arachnids are the friendly, candy-loving sort and they\u2019d love nothing better than to march across your buffet table and perch on the edge of your plate. So grab your sugar googly eyes and pick up some licorice \u2014 your Halloween is about to get crafty. <br> I am not normally the crafty sort, but discovering candy googly eyes on a visit to Target combined with a nostalgia-induced craving for grape-flavored Nerds sparked my inner Martha Stewart. You could really use any candy here, but I particularly like the nubbly, cartoon-ish texture of the Nerds. I tried crushed Whoppers as well, and consider these \u201chairy\u201d spiders a close second to the purple ones. <br> You do need to use homemade marshmallows for this particular edible craft project. Store-bought marshmallows are already coated with powdered sugar so the candies won\u2019t stick. Homemade marshmallows, however, are <br>powerful<br> sticky! Candy sticks to them like \u2014<br> ahem! \u2014<br> fly paper. If any candy falls off while you\u2019re assembling the spiders, just patch them back up again. I found that the candy also sticks better if you let them stand for an hour or so before attaching the legs or serving. <br> One thing to note is that the finished spiders are rather fragile. The candy coating sticks just fine, but the legs have a tendency to comically fall away if jostled too much. I suggest using a skewer to make sure the licorice \u201clegs\u201d are firmly poked into the marshmallow. It\u2019s also best if you assemble the spiders on the serving tray or individual plates on which you plan to serve them. <br> Alternatively, you could really serve these without the licorice legs and call them candy-coated ghouls! They\u2019re adorable either way \u2014 and just as delicious. <br> <br>Makes about 24 marshmallow spiders<br> <br> 1 batch <br>Fluffy Vanilla Marshmallows<br> 1/2 cup powdered sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 48 to 72 candy eyeballs (see Recipe Notes)<br> 1 cup grape-flavored Nerd candies, or 1 cup crushed Whoppers (or other candy, see Recipe Note)<br> 16 black licorice ropes <br> <br>Special Equipment: <br>1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, paring knife <br> Set the tray of marshmallows close to your work surface. Mix together the powdered sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl. Sprinkle a few spoonfuls of the powdered sugar mix over the marshmallow block and rub it into an even coating with your hands. <br> Using small round cutters dipped in warm water as needed to keep it from getting too sticky, cut rounds of marshmallows from the marshmallow block. As you cut each round, flip it upside down on a work surface so the side with the powdered sugar is down. Gently press 2 to 3 candy eyeballs near the top of each round. <br> Pour some of the Nerd candies onto a shallow dish. Coat each marshmallow on the top and sides through a combination of dipping the sticky surfaces of the marshmallow in the shallow dish and sprinkling the candies over the top. <br> As you finish coating each marshmallow, set it on a serving tray. The \u201cspider legs\u201d on the finished marshmallows are very fragile and it\u2019s best not to move the spiders once attaching the legs. <br> Cut each length of licorice crosswise into 3 \u201cleg-length\u201d pieces. Cut each piece lengthwise into 4 thin strips. Score each strip about 1/3 of the way down \u2014 do not cut all the way through. Bend each licorice strip and poke the end closest to the bend into the marshmallow close to the top \u2014 attach 4 legs on each side of the spider. The legs should arch up with the tips resting on the serving tray. <br>It can be difficult to secure the legs to the marshmallows \u2014 I found it helpful to use a skewer to push the end of the licorice into the marshmallow. <br> <br> Some of the candy pieces might have fallen off while attaching the legs. Once the legs are attached, patch up any spots. <br> Marshmallow spiders can be prepared several hours in advance of serving, but the legs are very fragile, so individual spiders shouldn\u2019t be moved until ready to eat. <br> <br>Candy eyeballs: <br>Candy eyeballs are available at most craft supply stores and at stores like Target around Halloween. <br> <br>Candy options: <br>Almost any candy can be used to coat the marshmallows. Crush larger candies to small pieces in a food processor before using. <br> <br>Storing leftover marshmallows: <br>The marshmallow leftover after cutting out the rounds can be cut into bite-sized pieces, tossed with the leftover powdered sugar mix, and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for several weeks.

        "<br> Is there anything that spells <br>party<br> more than glow-in-the-dark jello shots? When lit up by a black light in the dark, these spooky shots look like a mad scientist whipped them up in a laboratory. <br> You might think that this requires some spooky alchemy, but the secret ingredient is so simple and easy: tonic water, which contains quinine that lights up under UV light. <br> This jello shot is a twist on the classic gin and tonic with a hint of lime juice and splash of rosewater for a floral finish. (Who says jello shots can\u2019t be classy?) <br> The tonic is heated through and combined with gelatin and sugar, and stirred until the mixture has dissolved. Once it\u2019s cooled you can add in your gin, lime juice, and rosewater. As long as you use tonic as the base, you can swap the alcohol to vodka and other spirits if you like. <br> Refrigerate the jello shots for a few hours to let them set. These jiggly shots are perfect to make ahead of time, leaving you more time to work on your Halloween costume. (May we suggest a mad scientist to go with these ghostly, glowing concoctions?) <br> When you\u2019re ready to serve, place a UV black light as close to the shots as you can and switch off the lights for ultimate spooky presentation. Your room will light up with these ghostly glowing drinks! ",

        "Recipe: Sweet Potato Hash with Sausage & Eggs",
        "<br> I have told you that brunch is my <br>favorite meal of the day<br>, and winter is perhaps the high point for brunch. But while I am looking forward to these sleepy morning meals, I have to admit that many brunch recipes are too sweet for me. If this <br>sweet monkey bread with a gooey glaze<br> showed up it certainly wouldn\u2019t go to waste, but I would need something else too, something to nourish and satisfy. I need something savory to start the day off right. <br> The other requirement for a good brunch recipe, of course, is that it be easy to make ahead. Because who can roll out dough and fry potatoes <br>before<br> breakfast? Not me. So I must tell you about my make-ahead favorite recipe for a big family brunch: savory, garlicky sweet potato hash, roasted with sausage and rosemary, and baked the next day with eggs on top. <br> This entire thing is made ahead. (No chopping sweet potatoes at 9 a.m.) In the morning you spread the refrigerated hash in a big pan, and crack a few eggs on top. Slide it into a hot oven, and go make coffee. When you come back the potatoes will be hot and crisped, and the eggs just baked. Easy, nourishing, delicious \u2014 your kitchen will smell amazing, and you\u2019ll be ready to serve a crowd. <br> And don\u2019t worry \u2014 you\u2019ll still have plenty of room for something sweet, too. <br> This recipe is also very vegetarian-friendly. You can leave the sausage out entirely, or substitute Soy-Rizo or another vegetarian sausage. And it\u2019s flexible; the proportions are all quite forgiving. <br> A couple other small notes: I leave the potato skins on, for convenience and for flavor, so I really do prefer organic potatoes given that their skins are staying on. Also, if you can find Italian sausage with fennel seed, scoop it up for this dish; it\u2019s delicious with the sweet potatoes. <br> This feeds at least eight, and I think it really could be stretched to more, depending on how many eggs you bake, and what else is served. I\u2019m thinking of this with <br>cream cheese braids<br>, some fruit, and coffee. Brunch heaven! <br> <br>Tester\u2019s Notes<br> <br>This sweet and spicy hash makes a full sheet pan of sweet potatoes, crispy crumbles of sausage, and eight or more tender eggs, so make sure you\u2019ve got every seat at the table filled or reserve half the batch for dinner later in the week. If you aren\u2019t in a rush, cook the sausage in the same pan as the onions after they caramelize to pick up all of the flavorful crispy bits from the bottom of the pan. One word of warning: It\u2019s tough to go back to your everyday red potato hash once you\u2019ve tried this. <br> <br>\u2014<br>Patty<br>, October 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Quick Vietnamese Beef Noodle Pho",
        "<br> Vietnamese beef noodle pho is an easy soup to fall in love with. Those chewy noodles, that savory broth, the tender slices of beef \u2014 all those crunchy, spicy, herby garnishes we get to toss on top. On a cold evening, after a rough day at work, when we\u2019re sick, on a lazy weekend afternoon \u2014 a bowl of piping hot pho is pretty much always a good idea. <br> Beef pho (pronounced \u201c<br>fuh<br>\u201c!) feels like a restaurant staple, but it\u2019s actually not all that hard to make a quick version at home. This recipe for quick Vietnamese beef pho was one of our favorites from <br>The Kitchn Cookbook<br>;<br> so much so that we wanted to walk you through how to make it, step by step. <br> As much as we love those chewy rice noodles and tender bites of meat, Vietnamese pho is really all about the broth. True pho broth is a long-simmered affair, combining chicken or beef bones (or both!) with aromatics like onions and ginger to make a deeply rich, deeply savory broth. Making a great broth is a process that takes hours \u2014 sometimes days. <br> While this kind of slow-cooked pho is absolutely peerless, we can make a much quicker version using store-bought beef stock. This \u201cquick\u201d pho doesn\u2019t have quite the same depth or home-cooked flavor, but when a pho craving hits on a random weeknight and we just need a bowl of tasty noodles, it gets the job done. <br> We can also get close to the flavors of real pho broth by taking just a little time to infuse the broth with some aromatics. Simmered for 30 minutes with some onions, ginger, whole spices, soy sauce, and a dash of fish sauce \u2014 we can make a simple pho broth that tastes pretty darn good. I also like to add carrots to my broth \u2014 it\u2019s not traditional, but I like the sweetness and body they add. <br> Top choices for beef pho are sirloin steak, round eye, or London broil. All of these are quick-cooking pieces of beef that won\u2019t leave you chewing for hours. My favorite of the bunch is round eye, which is what I\u2019ve used today \u2014 this cut is leaner than sirloin and I like its beefy flavor, especially in this pho. <br> A bowl of pho is more than the sum of its parts. Each bowl gets constructed individually. Tender rice noodles are on the bottom with a layer of thinly sliced raw beef on top. Then the piping-hot broth gets ladled over the top, cooking the beef. To ensure the beef gets cooked through, slice it as thinly as possible (sticking it in the freezer for 15 minutes before slicing helps with this). Also, arrange it in just a single layer over the noodles when it\u2019s time to build the bowl. Slices that are clumped together or stacked up won\u2019t cook through all the way to the middle. <br> And don\u2019t fret about serving \u201craw\u201d meat at the table \u2014 as long your broth is steaming-hot, it will cook the beef. You\u2019ll see the meat turn opaque and brown as you pour on the broth; however, like steak, it\u2019s okay if you still see a bit of pink. <br> But we\u2019re not done yet! In the middle of the table should be a plate of fresh herbs, bean sprouts, sliced scallions and chili peppers, wedges of lime, and any other fresh garnishes the cook feels like providing. Each diner gets their own bowl of pho and can garnish it however they like. Personally, I love lots of lime, crunchy bean sprouts, torn bits of basil, and a good squeeze of Sriracha to finish it off. <br> Do you love pho? What\u2019s your favorite way to make it? <br> \u2192 <br>The Kitchn Cookbook<br> ",

        "<br> Oh, monkey bread! How we love you \u2014 little pull-apart nuggets of buttery, gooey cinnamon goodness. And I\u2019ve been thinking about how easy monkey bread is when you\u2019ve been making pizza! What? How are they related? Well, leftover pizza dough is a perfect base for monkey bread and other breakfast treats. And even if you haven\u2019t been making pizza lately, store-bought, ready-made pizza dough is also a way to get these into the oven (and into your mouth!) that much quicker. <br> These little monkey breads are designed for eating on the go a little more easily than the full-sized traditional monkey bread that needs to be picked apart piece by piece. They are baked in muffin cups, and they come out all gooey and crisp from the butter. They get a lovely lemony glaze, creamy and touched by honey. <br> And yet they\u2019re not too sweet. That\u2019s the beauty of using pizza dough here \u2014 it\u2019s not too rich, and not sweet at all. So you have chunks of dough, yeasty and tender, encased and baked in a buttery, cinnamon glaze, and tumbled together with chopped apples, raisins, and (if you like!) dried cranberries. <br> All together these are a marvelous breakfast treat \u2014 warm and sweet from the oven, and good for eating on the go, or at a leisurely breakfast with family. <br> And one last note: For anyone who has ever had the cobblestone at Panera Bread, that muffin-shaped monkey bread of cinnamon, raisins, and citrus glaze, these are really an attempt to get them at home. I like these much better \u2014 they have all the right flavors, but they\u2019re not so teeth-achingly sweet. <br> <br>Makes 12 mini monkey breads<br> <br> Cooking spray<br> 1 1/2 pounds prepared pizza dough OR 1 batch dough (below), at room temperature<br> Flour, for dusting the dough<br> 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 2/3 cup mixed dried fruit, such a mix of raisins, currants, and cranberries<br> 2 small or 1 large apple (about 8 ounces total)<br> 2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> Finely grated zest of 1 medium lemon <br> <br>For the glaze:<br> 1 tablespoon heavy cream or milk<br> 2 teaspoons honey<br> 3/4 to 1 cup powdered sugar<br> Juice of 1 medium lemon (about 3 tablespoons) <br> Lightly coat a large piece of parchment paper or baking sheet with baking spray. Place the dough on it and pat into a rough 2-inch-thick rectangle. Use a knife or bench scraper to cut it into 4 equal pieces. Cut each piece into 12 lumps, for a total of about 48 dough lumps about the size of your thumb. Sprinkle flour over top of the dough pieces, cover with towel, and set aside while you prepare the monkey bread filling. <br> Prepare a 12-cup muffin pan by lightly greasing the wells or lining with paper muffin cups; set aside. <br> Melt the butter in a saucepan or the microwave. Stir in the vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and salt and set aside to cool to room temperature. <br> Coarsely chop the dried fruit and place in a large bowl. Peel and core the apples, and grate them on the large holes of a box grater into the bowl with the dried fruit. Add the brown sugar and lemon zest and stir to combine. <br> Sprinkle the dough pieces again lightly with flour, to help keep them from sticking to each other, then add the bowl of dried fruit and toss to combine. Pour in the cooled melted butter and stir to coat the pieces of dough. <br> Quickly scoop up handfuls of the dough and fruit mixture and place them in muffin cups (about 4 pieces to each cup). If there is any leftover butter in the bowl, pour this evenly over the monkey breads. <br> Set aside in a warm place to rise for 1 hour. About 20 minutes before the dough is ready, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400\u00b0F. <br> Bake until browned on top and the insides register about 190\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze. <br> Heat the cream and honey in the microwave or in a small saucepan until the honey is dissolved. Add 3/4 cup of the powdered sugar and the lemon juice and whisk until it forms a thick, creamy glaze. If the glaze is too thin, whisk in more powered sugar a tablespoon at a time. <br> Remove the monkey breads from the oven and drizzle the glaze over the tops. Serve warm. <br> <br>Makes 1 1/2 pounds of dough, enough for 1 batch of Monkey Bread<br> <br> 3 1/2 cups all-purpose or bread flour<br> 2 teaspoons instant yeast<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> 2 tablespoons olive or canola oil<br> 1 1/4 cups cold or lukewarm water <br> Place the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and stir to combine. Slowly mix in the oil and water. Knead for 5 to 7 minutes by hand or with the dough hook of a stand mixer, until the dough is smooth, stretchy, and pliable. Proceed with Monkey Bread recipe (above). <br> <br>Storage:<br> Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. <br> <br>\u2022 <br>Recipe: Monkey Bread with Bourbon Cr\u00e8me Anglaise<br> ",

        "Recipe: Restaurant-Style Mexican Rice",
        "<br> If you\u2019ve ever attempted your favorite Mexican restaurant\u2019s rice at home and failed, raise your hand. Well, you can put it down now, because this one is my all-time family favorite and I think it will become yours, too. To be honest, I like it so much <br>better<br> than the rice usually served when I dine out. <br> Whenever I go to Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurants, I always find myself dumping salsa and queso over my rice to make it more delicious. I\u2019ve always thought it had potential, though, and over the years I\u2019ve tested countless different recipes in my quest to master it at home. <br> The funny thing is that I\u2019m actually not a rice-lover at all, which probably explains why I like Mexican rice \u2014 because you\u2019re <br>supposed<br> to add a bunch of stuff to make it better! The best kind of Mexican rice, to me at least, is infused with a complex tomato flavor and each grain has just the right amount of bite; no mush, please! (Cheese dip optional but not required.) <br> A few years ago I finally found a recipe that came close to what I was looking for. It came from one of those generic crowd-sourced websites, but despite my doubts it actually proved to be a keeper. Well, a keeper that needed some work. (Once a recipe developer, always a recipe developer.) But now that I had a solid base to play with, I could tweak and adapt it to my personal tastes, and eventually I came up with a streamlined version I think is pretty close to perfect. <br> The key to this recipe is to saut\u00e9 the rice in sizzling oil until toasted and golden brown. This helps the grains keep some of their texture after they are cooked. Next, the rice simmers in a puree of tomatoes, onions, and chicken stock to really absorb all of those delicious additional flavors. A handful of cilantro, a few big squeezes of lime, and a light fluff with a fork guarantees the best rice ever, every single time. <br> Now I can\u2019t say if this recipe is anything close to authentic (probably not), but I do know that it\u2019s damn good. I suggest playing around with it to make it your own. I love the loaded tomato flavor, but you can reduce the amount of tomatoes and sub in more stock if you want a slightly mellower taste. If you like lots of heat, go big on the fresh chiles, but whatever you do don\u2019t skip the cilantro \u2014 I think it\u2019s a must. (And if you need something to serve with your new favorite rice, I highly recommend a batch of <br>Delta Hot Tamales<br>!) ",

        "How To Cook Moist & Tender Chicken Breasts Every Time",
        "<br> Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (aka BSCBs) \u2014 is there anything more boring? They are all too often overcooked until dry and chewy, and I generally prefer more succulent <br>boneless, skinless thighs<br>. But for lunch and dinner favorites like chicken Caesar salad and chicken pasta, sliced juicy chicken breasts can\u2019t be beat. They\u2019re a great staple for <br>quick lunches<br>, too. <br> Fortunately I have one method that makes unfailingly juicy and tender boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Need some chicken for a salad, or to top some pasta? This is <br>the<br> method. It takes some trust, but believe me \u2014 it works flawlessly <br>every single time<br>. <br> This method takes trust; you can\u2019t check the chicken breasts or watch them cooking. The method isn\u2019t searing, saut\u00e9ing, broiling, frying, or baking; it heats the chicken breasts quickly on the stovetop then lets them essentially poach from the inside out in their juices in a covered pan. <br> So you can\u2019t peek, and you have to trust us. But I promise that if you follow this method exactly, you won\u2019t be disappointed. I learned this cooking method from an old edition of <br>Joy of Cooking<br>, which gives this method its special label: <br>Cockaigne<br>, reserved for only their personal favorite and best recipes. <br> This method alone makes plain, simple chicken breasts \u2014 a blank slate to be used on top of salads, rice dishes, and tacos. But you can season the breasts any way you like; make them spicy, or flavor them with fresh herbs. <br> You don\u2019t need to brine or marinate the chicken, but a quick brine does make them even juicier! Go <br>here<br> for instructions on how to make a super-quick 15-minute brine. (If you use a brine, make sure to pat the chicken very dry before proceeding with the cooking method below.) <br> Since we originally published this a few years ago, I\u2019ve been surprised at the number of people who have written or commented to say they really love it. It\u2019s truly reliable! <br> There have been questions about it too \u2014 for instance, do you adjust the cooking time if the chicken breasts are extra big? <br> I don\u2019t; I find that this works across a spectrum of size and weight, provided the breasts are separated into individual halves and they are flattened to even thickness during the prep. <br> I also originally published this very close to <br>Joy of Cooking<br>\u2018s method, which calls for you to dredge the breasts in flour. I\u2019ve found this is unnecessary, and also undesirable for those who eat gluten-free. I\u2019ve adjusted the method below to not include flour \u2014 just salt and pepper. But you are free to tweak and adjust; there are some great suggestions in the comments for dredging in alternative flours like chickpea, and seasoning with all kinds of spices or herbs. <br> This is truly just a blank slate method; it makes nicely cooked and juicy chicken breast for topping salads and other dishes. I usually make about one pound of chicken breasts at a time, which gives me enough chicken for a few days of salads and lunches. But if you want to turn it into a meal on its own, get creative! No matter how you season them, you\u2019ll have juicy, tender chicken breasts. \u2014 <br>Faith, September 2014<br> <br> <br> <br>Updated from post originally published February 2011. <br> ",

        "How To Make Homemade Candy Corn",
        "<br> There is a particular emotion that comes from creating something that, up until that very moment, felt like the un-reproduceable creation of some industrial food lab. The feeling is a mixture of pride, satisfaction, and outright elation. It also feels a little like having superpowers. <br> Make this recipe for candy corn and you can ride that emotion for days. Because by golly, <br>you made candy corn<br>! Sure, you can easily buy a bag of the stuff and save yourself the trouble, but that\u2019s no way to become a superhero. Go on. Impress your friends and family. Make a batch of candy corn. Here\u2019s our DIY recipe and step-by-step guide. <br> Making homemade candy corn is a surprisingly un-scientific process. No unpronounceable ingredients or fancy stainless steel equipment required. Just some sugar, a pot, and a mixing bowl are all you need. <br> You make a sugar syrup, mix in some powdered sugar, and shape this into a workable dough. We\u2019re basically making edible Play-Doh \u2014 and yes, that\u2019s as awesome as it sounds. <br> There is a bit of candy-making required here, but it\u2019s Candy-Making 101. I definitely recommend having a candy thermometer or instant-read thermometer to keep track of the temperature of the sugar syrup as it cooks, but that\u2019s the most stressful this recipe gets. Also, we\u2019re only cooking the sugar syrup to the lower end of the candy spectrum \u2014 at this stage, if you over-reach your temperature goal, you can add a splash of water to the pan to bring down the temperature and take another run at it. <br> Once you have the dough, making the actual candy corn shapes is like a grade-school craft project. All the rolling, shaping, and cutting can get a bit tedious, so be sure to have a podcast or some good music on in the background. <br> Before you ask, I will tell you that this recipe uses corn syrup, and unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a good recommendation for a substitute. Candy corn is such an occasional thing for me, and corn syrup is so good at what it does (namely, making candy-making easy and preventing the sugar from crystalizing), that I feel fine using non-high-fructose corn syrup in this recipe. This is personally speaking, of course. I\u2019d love to hear thoughts on good substitutes in the comments section. <br> This candy corn tastes like the real thing, which is to say, it tastes addictively sweet. Best of all, homemade candy corn has that exact same candy corn texture: chewy at first, and then dissolving into delicious ephemeral sugariness. <br> If you don\u2019t like store-bought candy corn, then you\u2019re probably not going to be a big fan of the homemade version. But if you love candy corn, then this recipe will blow you away. <br> The texture of this candy is a direct result of how much you cook the initial candy syrup. I tried batches with the syrup cooked to 235\u00b0F, 245\u00b0F, and 255\u00b0F \u2014 the first batch made soft, taffy-like candies, and the last batch made a dough that was almost too stiff to easily shape. I found that the sweet spot is cooking the syrup to between 245\u00b0F and 250\u00b0F. This made an easily workable dough with chewy, but soft candies. <br> I like the way you think! The possibilities for this dough are endless; it is easily dyed to any color and easily moldable to any shape. You can use it to make fun cake toppers or personalized treats. Don\u2019t stop at candy corn \u2014 the world is your oyster. ",

Continue cooking without stirring until the syrup is reaches 245\u00b0F to 250\u00b0F. Depending on your stove, this will take anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes. If you go over the temperature, quickly add a few tablespoons of water to the pan to reduce the temperature, and monitor the temperature carefully as it reheats. Remove from heat immediately once the syrup reaches temperature.",

            " Knead both pieces of dough until uniform in color. Be sure to leave the remaining white piece of dough well away from the kneading area so it doesn't get any color. Knead against the baking mat so you don't dye your countertop or work surface. You can also knead more dye into the dough if the color doesn't seem quite right to you.",

            " Pinch off a piece of dough from each section roughly the size of a ping-pong ball. Roll each one into a thin 1/4-inch-thick rope. If a rope gets too long and hard to roll, you can break off the end and mush it back into the remaining dough.",
            "Pinch the ropes gently together:",
            " Lay the ropes side by side in whatever order you like (yellow-orange-white is classic!), and then gently pinch them together so they stick to each other.",
            "Flatten slightly with a rolling pin:",
            " Gently roll over the ropes with a rolling pin just to flatten out the curved edges.",
            "Cut out triangles of candy corn:",
            " Use the bench scraper or chef's knife to cut out triangles of candy. Angle your scraper at a forward-slash angle and then at a back-slash angle as you work down the length of the ropes.",
            "Repeat with remaining dough:",
            " Continue rolling and cutting the dough until it's all used up. If the dough becomes too stiff to work with, microwave individual pieces in 5-second increments until it becomes pliable again.",
            "Dry the candies:",
            " Spread the candies out onto the baking sheet to dry for a few hours. Separate any candies that are sticking together. Once dry, the candies can be stored in an airtight container for several weeks. Like commercial candy corn, these candies are good until they become too dry to chew!"

        "<br> Apple cinnamon toaster strudels, those super-sweet frozen pastries, were definitely a guilty pleasure growing up. I have to admit, it\u2019s been years since I last enjoyed one \u2014 until this recipe came along. <br> Using the frozen strudels as a guide, I came up with a pretty specific formula for how I wanted mine to look and taste. I wanted a thick apple pur\u00e9e, as opposed to a chunky pie filling, and a super-flaky crust. Lastly I wanted a creamy, tangy glaze that rivaled the flavor of the packaged stuff. <br> These homemade toaster strudels might not be a quick-fix meal, but they are definitely a special treat. I\u2019ve now got quite a stockpile that I\u2019m looking forward to pulling out when I need to impress guests. And don\u2019t think you can only serve these for breakfast \u2014 they make a perfect snack morning, noon, and night. ",

Cover and soak overnight, 10 to 12 hours. ",
            "Drain the soaked beans and wipe out the slow cooker insert (if you used it). Return the beans to the slow cooker. Add the 4 cups of water, the bell pepper, onion, pancetta, tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, oregano, basil, dried thyme, and Parmesan rind if using. Give everything a swift, hearty stir to combine. Cover and cook until the beans are tender but not falling apart and the broth around the beans has thickened, 5 to 6 hours on the HIGH setting or 10 to 12 hours on the LOW setting.",
            "When the soup is ready, bring a large saucepan over water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the pasta and stir into the soup. Remove the bay leaves and Parmesan rind before serving. Top each bowl with fresh thyme and Parmesan. "

        "<br> There is no denying the light pillow-soft texture of a deep-fried donut \u2014 especially one that\u2019s stuffed with fresh fall apples. <br> Yes, they are deep fried. I decided to go against the current food blogging trend of baking donuts. I understand how, even aside from the calories, the thought of deep-frying is sort of scary for some of you. I get it \u2014 boiling oil equals hot, painful burns. Yep, been there (<br>don\u2019t<br> be like me and multi-task deep-frying with social media!). <br> Since this isn\u2019t the shortest recipe ever and it\u2019s a bit more advanced, I\u2019m sharing some tips to make sure things move along smoothly for you. <br> I\u2019ll start with the apples: core, peel, and chop your apples, then submerge them in ice-cold water with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Push the apples down and place a piece of parchment paper on top so the apples don\u2019t bob above the surface of the water. You can do this the night before so the apples are ready to go when you\u2019re ready to fry. <br> And here\u2019s a shortcut for proofing the dough: Place an oven thermometer inside your oven and heat the oven to 100\u00b0F, then turn it off. Wait until the oven thermometer inside reads 90\u00b0F then place your bowl of dough inside. I use this method a lot in the winter when warm spots in the house can be hard to find, plus it speeds up the proofing in recipes like this. If you use this method, make sure you have an oven thermometer and the temperature in the oven does not exceed 90\u00b0F. <br> Now for the deep-frying. You want to do your best and keep the oil at a steady 360\u00b0F. If it\u2019s too low, your fritters will absorb too much oil and become sodden; too high and the outsides will end up burnt, or worse \u2014 appear to be finished with a nice golden browning while the inside is still doughy. <br> Sound good? Not too scared? You shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 apple fritters await. Now lets get started. ",

            " Place the yeast, 3 cups of the flour, sugar, salt, and cinnamon in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and whisk to combine.

If dough starts to fall away from the dough hook, add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour 1 tablespoon at a time until dough comes back together before adding in next butter piece.",

            "Now rotate the tube of dough so it's perpendicular to your body. Flatten the tube slightly, then scatter the remaining apples over the surface. Roll up the tube like a snail's shell \u2014 the finished dough will look like a large ball.",

Some apples may pop out \u2014 don't worry if they do, just set them aside and pop them back in where you can. Use a bench scraper to cut the dough into 2 1/2-inch squares to make 12 fritters. Use your hand to and pull the four corners of each square towards the center. Again, don't worry about any apples falling out or if they are exposed. Pinch the dough together if needed to create a rough circle.",
            "Place the shaped fritters on a parchment-lined baking sheet and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for about 30 minutes or until the fritters puff and almost double in size",
            "Make the glaze.",
            " Sift the powdered sugar into a medium microwave-safe bowl bowl. Stir in the milk and vanilla until smooth. Set aside; warm in the microwave in 10-second bursts if the glaze starts to harden.",
            "Deep-fry the fritters.",
            " Heat 6 to 7 inches of oil to 360\u00b0F in a large Dutch oven. Meanwhile, line a wire rack with paper towels.",
            "Carefully lower 3 to 4 fritters into the hot oil. Fritters will float and not sink. Fry on one side for 30 to 60 seconds or until golden brown, then flip the fritter and fry the other side for 30 to 60 seconds or until golden brown. Remove fritter with a spider or slotted spoon and drain on prepared wire rack. Repeat with the remaining fritters. (Between batches, make sure the oil temperature returns to 360\u00b0F and remove any floating pieces of dough or apples.)",

        "How To Make a Molten Chocolate Bundt Cake",
        "<br> When Ella Helfrich of Houston, Texas, won second prize in the Pillsbury Bake-Off\u00ae Contest in 1966 with her Tunnel of Fudge cake, she made more than just a winning cake \u2014 she created both a 1960s phenomenon and a memory that lingers so strongly for a generation of cake bakers and eaters that even though the ingredients she used are long off the market, many bakers to this day tackle her curious recipe. I recently joined those bakers. This is the story of how you can make a delicious, fudge-filled chocolate Bundt cake that\u2019s all about the chocolate and fudge filling without a nut in sight, and that tastes like that memory. <br> Pillsbury made a basic frosting mix for years, and the clever Mrs. Helfrich combined a packet with Pillsbury\u2019s chocolate cake mix and baked it up in a newfangled, all-but-unknown decorative pan with a hole in the middle. The cake was dense with a variety of sugars, and a tunnel of fudgy gooey chocolatey goodness was the secret inside this innovative cake. Everyone wanted to make the cake. Bundt pan sales skyrocketed and the recipe itself was a national sensation. <br> No one could pinpoint how the magic tunnel o\u2019 yum was created, but everyone reveled in the results. <br> Then came a crushing blow to the tunnel o\u2019 fudge bakers: Pillsbury dropped the more labor-intensive dry frosting packet and marketed the easier-to-use canned frosting. Home bakers suffered trying to recreate the cake, and they caused such an uproar that the company brought the frosting mix back for awhile and developed its own \u201cfrom-scratch\u201d version of the cake, which did not require their soon-to-be obsolete mix. <br> Not every baker was happy. There arose a zillion recipes for the cake, but most have glaring issues like gloppiness, soggy bottoms, runny middles, burnt outsides, or all of the above. Many use a variety of additive-laden packaged items and pudding, not fudge \u2014 none of which the original used \u2014 and they didn\u2019t really create the same taste and texture. The biggest issue was that most offered inconsistent results. Then came a food scientist named Shirley O. Corriher. <br> In 2007 Corriher wrote <br>Bakewise: The Hows and Whys of Successful Baking<br> and offered up her brilliant and innovative version of the Tunnel of Fudge Cake. She upended the recipe by throwing all logic about cake baking ratios out the window, upping the sugar, enriching it with egg yolks, and baking it just so the fudgy center appeared like magic. It\u2019s a great recipe, if quite sweet. A key to both her cake and the Pillsbury version is the use of nuts. Lots and lots of nuts. The nuts provide physical structure. My quest was different. This was to be a cake that didn\u2019t need the architectural engineering of nuts. <br> My recipe tester is a veteran baking chef-instructor. When I showed her my first three ideas for this cake, she checked the baking numbers and was aghast, but game. Not one fit any ratio of any cake she had ever made. We talked for hours and consulted textbook after textbook. There was no doubt that the cake would need odd ratios, but the issue was twofold: Could I come up with a hack to create a great cake and great filling, and could I make it all without the nut scaffolding? I revised and recalculated. <br> None worked as planned. My dense ganache filling was absorbed by the cake, my fudge candy dissolved, and the fudge-brownie based versions wouldn\u2019t cook enough to invert and remove from the pan without oozing like mad. They were all delicious, mind you, but the texture was never right. That\u2019s not good enough to make a memory live again. <br> Oh, Mrs. Helfrich, some 11 cakes later, I was checking numbers, and lo and behold I realized that I should probably try to use the best version I had come up with and see if it worked with nuts the classic way, and deal with one problem at a time. I added 2 1/2 cups of toasted chopped pecans and, darn, that recipe worked great, as if it was the original. <br> <br>Note to baker: <br>For a nut-filled version, go ahead and add that 2 1/2 cups of toasted chopped pecans. <br> I thought about what to do to make the darn thing without the nut scaffolding. I tried baking cakes with some logistical changes, like heating the pan, popover-style, before adding the batter, but the results were too inconsistent. I was many, many weeks in and now baking two cakes a day, and no one in my house or at my catering job wanted to eat it anymore. I woke up at 4 a.m. to bake two cakes before we attended an afternoon wedding. Obsessed? Just a wee bit. <br> Four more cakes with just a few tweaks and finally, finally, it worked. No nuts and it worked. The cake held up. I baked it twice again and had my sister, who does not bake, bake it. Sure, it sank a bit every time on the fudgy part, as does every Tunnel of Fudge cake I had ever seen. This cake had a distinct fudgy center, and a cake outside that was moist and cooked. It was easy to cut through and serve beautiful slices. <br> I must thank Ms. Corriher. Some technical advice is absolutely taken from her version, like baking the cake for a precise amount of time and not checking for doneness and also allowing it to cool completely in the pan, but mostly and yet again, what I learned was her scientific approach to baking. I hope you love it as much as we do in my kitchen. <br> This cake was delicious without the glaze, but the glaze does dress it up and adds a milkier chocolate layer of flavor. It\u2019s really up to you if you want to gild this lily. Just make sure to have plenty of whipped cream or ice cream on hand and simply enjoy. ",

        "How To Make Yogurt at Home",
        "<br> I\u2019ve been making my own yogurt for a few years now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go back. Not only does it actually save me some grocery money, but this homemade yogurt is seriously good. I\u2019m eating more yogurt now than ever before. <br> The method I\u2019ve adopted is very basic \u2014 no special heirloom yogurt cultures or fancy incubating equipment required. You could even make a batch tonight and have homemade yogurt for breakfast by tomorrow morning! <br> All you need to make homemade yogurt is a half gallon of milk and about a half cup of yogurt. Whole or 2% milk will make the thickest, creamiest yogurt, but you can also use skim milk if you like. For the yogurt, either Greek or regular yogurt is fine, but avoid any flavorings; stick to plain, unflavored yogurts. <br> When you\u2019re buying yogurt, also check that it lists \u201cLive Active Yogurt Cultures\u201d in the ingredients \u2014 we need those! The live cultures are what actually turn the milk into yogurt. The number of cultures doesn\u2019t really matter; as long as there is at least one, you can make yogurt. This said, different strains of bacteria have different health benefits, so I personally look for the yogurt with the most number of cultures listed. Some common ones are <br>L. Bulgaricus, S. Thermophilus, L. Acidophilus, Bifidus, L. Casei.<br> <br> All you need to make yogurt is a heavy pot with a lid. I like to use a 3-quart Dutch oven. Once the lid is on, a heavy pot like this does an admirable job of keeping the milk cozy and at a fairly steady temperature (ideally around 110\u00b0F) while the bacteria go to work turning the milk into yogurt. It also helps to put the pot somewhere insulated and warm while this is happening, like an oven with the light turned on or a picnic cooler with a hot water bottle. <br> You can certainly use a yogurt maker or even a dehydrator if you have one \u2014 these are great for holding the yogurt at a very steady temperature as it incubates \u2014 but you can make great yogurt without them. <br> Once you have this basic method for making yogurt down pat, there are all sorts of tweaks and changes you can make. Some people like to add dry milk powder or <br>gelatin<br> for extra thickness, others like to strain off the liquid whey for a dense <br>Greek-style yogurt<br>. Using different brands of commercial yogurt to culture the milk can also give you subtly different flavors and nutritional benefits. <br> You can also try purchasing a special starter from a health food store, food co-op or online. My favorite resource for interesting starters is Cultures for Health. <br> Do you make your own yogurt? What\u2019s your favorite method? ",

Avoid jostling or stirring the yogurt until it has fully set.",

            " Once the yogurt has set to your liking, remove it from the oven. If you see any watery whey on the surface of the yogurt, you can either drain this off or whisk it back into the yogurt before transferring to containers. Whisking also gives the yogurt a more consistent creamy texture. Transfer the to storage containers, cover, and refrigerate. Homemade yogurt will keep for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.",
            "Your next batch of homemade yogurt.",
            " Once you start making your own yogurt, you can use some of each batch to culture your next batch. Just save 1/2 cup to use for this purpose. If after a few batches, you notice some odd flavors in your yogurt or that it's not culturing quite as quickly, that means that either some outside bacteria has taken up residence in your yogurt or that this strain is becoming weak. As long as this batch still tastes good to you, it will be safe to eat, but go back to using some store-bought commercial yogurt in your next batch."

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Spiked Mulled Cider",
        "<br> Mulling season is upon us, and everyone needs a good spiked mulled cider recipe up their sleeve to serve at a holiday party or after a long day of skiing and sledding. This easy slow cooker version makes the most of fresh apple cider, fragrant spices, and of course, the nice body-warming effects of bourbon, brandy, or dark rum. <br> If you\u2019re serving mulled cider to a range of guests that includes children and those who don\u2019t want alcohol, a spike-it-yourself mulled cider station is your best bet to make the drink friendly to all. But if everyone\u2019s happy to partake, spiking the whole batch is the way to go. <br> But what booze is the right booze? I find that the darker, more caramel-y flavors of brown liquors work best in mulled apple cider. Bourbon, brandy, or even a dark aged rum have enough oomph to stand up to the sweet flavors of the spices and apple cider. <br> As to when to add in the booze, it\u2019s best to wait until the mulling spices have flavored everything first. If you add the alcohol in the beginning, it gives the mulled cider a slightly bitter taste. Wait until the mulling is done, add the booze, and let the flavors meld together for a few minutes, then keep warm and serve. <br> Spiked apple cider isn\u2019t terribly boozy (only 3/4 ounce alcohol in an eight-ounce serving), so you can enjoy a few mugs, but there\u2019s just enough in there to warm up your throat and tummy as you sip and savor.

        "How To Make the Creamiest Mashed Cauliflower",
        "<br> Long before <br>cauliflower pizza crusts<br>, <br>cauliflower cakes<br>, and <br>cauliflower couscous<br>, there were just a few folks looking for a lighter dish to enjoy in lieu of mashed potatoes. The popularity of all these cauliflower dishes is evident in the availability of pre-riced cauliflower widely available at most grocery stores. Lucky for us, that means all the knife work of making mashed cauliflower is already done. <br> But before we designate mashed cauliflower as just a lighter version of mashed potatoes, let\u2019s consider why it is a side dish with merits all its own. <br> You can\u2019t over-mash or over-whip cauliflower the way you can potatoes. Without potato\u2019s starch to contend with, you can pur\u00e9e the cauliflower all day with no risk of gumminess. <br> And then there\u2019s the taste: Mashed cauliflower has an earthy, nutty flavor, which means it offers some complexity to the final dish that really needs nothing more than butter and salt to feel complete. <br> The best cauliflower for making creamy mashed cauliflower is the prepackaged \u201criced\u201d cauliflower. Because the riced cauliflower is already cut into tiny pieces, it will cook faster and mash easier without any extra prep work on your part. <br> However, you can still make this recipe with fresh or frozen cauliflower \u2014 just adjust the boiling time as needed to make sure the cauliflower is tender. Fresh cauliflower will take a few minutes longer, while frozen will actually be tender faster, as it was briefly cooked before freezing. <br> <br>Steer clear of colorful cauliflower: <br>Although yellow, green, and purple varieties of cauliflower are still available in the fall, their colors don\u2019t hold up well to boiling and pur\u00e9eing, so stick to white cauliflower for mashing. <br> <br>Want to rice your own cauliflower?<br> <br>How To Make Cauliflower Rice or Couscous<br> <br> Unlike potatoes, which require a tender touch to prevent gumminess, cauliflower can take some extra heat when cooking (pun intended). Before boiling, saut\u00e9 the cauliflower in a bit of butter to deepen its flavor. This also helps the cauliflower boil faster once the water is added to the pot. Don\u2019t worry about overcooking the cauliflower \u2014 the longer it cooks, the creamier the results \u2014 but try to use as little water as possible to avoid it becoming waterlogged. We\u2019ve called for two cups in the recipe below, which should just barely cover the cauliflower in a four-quart pot. <br> <br>Save some cooking water:<br> Reserve 1/4 cup of the cauliflower cooking liquid for mashing. This creamier water is a flavorful alternative to using milk or cream for creamy mashed cauliflower. <br> Once drained, the cauliflower can be mashed or pur\u00e9ed, depending on your desired consistency. A traditional potato masher will give a chunky, rustic texture. Pur\u00e9eing with an immersion blender is preferred, as you can pur\u00e9e it as smooth or as chunky as you like, and it will create that rich emulsion of butter and cauliflower. In a pinch, a stand blender or food processor can be used to pur\u00e9e the cauliflower as well. <br> You may notice that there is no actual cream in a recipe titled \u201ccreamiest mashed cauliflower.\u201d While we tried testing this recipe with both whole milk and cream, these muted the cauliflower\u2019s nuttiness and didn\u2019t improve the texture of the pur\u00e9ed cauliflower. Instead, a bit of the cauliflower\u2019s cooking liquid is used to create a creamy emulsion with the aid of an immersion blender. This makes the dish lighter in texture without the heaviness of cream. ",

        "How To Make Stuffed Peppers",
        "<br> Stuffed peppers are what dinner dreams are made of. They can be filled with any combination of starches, meat, beans, and sauces, making them the ultimate leftover vehicle. The peppers steam and bake in the oven into supple submission, making them a mostly hands-off dish. <br> Stuffed peppers were clearly born from a need to use up leftovers. Most recipes call for at least cooked rice and often cooked beans. Frozen rice and canned beans are welcome to be used as needed to fill these peppers. The beauty is that you can easily substitute leftover quinoa or couscous for the rice, or use leftover roast chicken in place of the ground beef. The canned tomatoes can be replaced with salsa \u2014 just don\u2019t skip the tomatoes all together, and make sure to drain them first. <br> Some recipes call for saving the pepper tops and using them as a lid for the peppers. This recipe calls for dicing them and tossing them into the filling \u2014 both to bulk up the filling and add a touch of sweetness. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love to see melty cheese on the top of the open-faced peppers? <br> To ensure soft and tender peppers, we\u2019ve updated this recipe to just cook and steam the peppers all in one go under a blanket of aluminum foil in the oven once they\u2019re stuffed. It takes more baking time than the original recipe, but it\u2019s all hands-off time. We\u2019ve also bumped up the seasonings to make sure every bite is flavorful and makes you want to go back for more. These stuffed peppers are the perfect one-dish meal! <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Christine<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "Recipe: Peanut Butter and Chocolate Graveyard Dirt Cake",
        "<br> I\u2019ll be honest: dirt cake has never really been my thing. Most versions involve pudding filled with fake flavoring, gobs of non-dairy whipped topping and Day-Glo gummy worms \u2014 a dream come true for kids or a big crowd of drunk dudes (more on that later), but I need a little more. Like two layers of homemade pudding, one lightly salted peanut butter, the other dark chocolate, that together taste like the grown up version of a Reese\u2019s peanut butter cup, sandwiched between two layers of crumbled cookie. <br> And because it\u2019s Halloween, and this is still a dirt cake, it\u2019s topped with a fun mini graveyard, made with Nutter Butter cookies and whipped cream ghosts. <br> I am not officially the dirt cake expert in my house. That honor goes to my husband, Rob, who makes a giant dirt cake every summer for the annual crawfish boil he hosts with friends. Its ingredients are one store-bought chocolate sheet cake, several tubs of Kozy Shack pudding, a package of crushed Oreos and Cool Whip. He serves it in a giant plastic flower pot with flowers sticking out of the top and it is always a hit with the partygoers drunk on beer and crawfish tails. <br> I am the only naysayer. Every year I try to nudge him into swapping out one of the packaged ingredients for a homemade replacement (\u201cHow about whipped cream instead of Cool Whip? Please? I\u2019ll whip it for you!\u201d) and he keeps refusing, saying that everyone loves his dirt cake, so why would he change it? He\u2019s right. His dirt cake is his dirt cake and he doesn\u2019t need to change it. <br> This dirt cake, however, is <br>my<br> dirt cake, so I get to make it exactly how I like. And that means adapting one of my favorite peanut butter and chocolate layered pudding recipes, increasing the salt in the peanut layer and replacing the milk chocolate with imported dark chocolate for a richer flavor with more depth. Although making not one but two puddings from scratch is a good deal more difficult than opening a container of Kozy Shack, that doesn\u2019t mean the process is actually difficult. Cornstarch-thickened pudding cooks up quickly, and once the pudding layers are poured over the bottom layer of chocolate cookie chunks, it\u2019s waiting for them to chill in the refrigerator that is the killer. <br> If you plan on making the dirt cake for an occasion other than Halloween, you can skip the decorating \u2014 just sprinkle cookie crumbs over the top and serve it with whipped cream \u2014 but for a themed party, the Nutter Butter gravestones and whipped cream ghosts are a must. No matter how dressed up, it\u2019s still dirt cake after all. It\u2019s supposed to be fun! <br> <br>Serves 8 to 10<br> <br> <br>For the toppings:<br> 20 chocolate cream sandwich cookies, such as Oreos, divided<br> 8 Nutter Butter cookies, divided<br> 1/2 cup cold heavy cream<br> 2 teaspoons powdered sugar<br> Black or brown icing <br> <br>For the peanut butter pudding:<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 5 teaspoons cornstarch<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 3/4 cups whole milk<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 cup creamy natural peanut butter (made with just peanuts and salt)<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br> <br>For the dark chocolate pudding:<br> 6 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons natural unsweetened cocoa powder<br> Pinch salt<br> 1 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 4 ounces good-quality dark chocolate, finely chopped<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br> <br>Make the toppings: <br>Place half of the chocolate cookies in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse a few times until broken up roughly. Transfer to an 8-inch square baking dish and spread into an even layer. Place the remaining chocolate cookies in the food processor and process into fine crumbs. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. <br> Brush out the food processor bowl with a towel. Add 4 of the Nutter Butter cookies and process into fine crumbs; set aside. (If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can crush the cookies in a resealable bag with a rolling pin or other heavy kitchen implement.) <br> <br>Make the peanut butter pudding:<br> Place the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large, heavy saucepan and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in the milk, followed by the cream. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking frequently to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Boil, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 30 seconds. <br> Whisk in peanut butter and boil, whisking frequently, until thickened again, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla. Pour over the coarse chocolate cookie crumbs in the baking dish and smooth the surface with an offset spatula. Refrigerate uncovered while making the chocolate pudding. <br> <br>Make the dark chocolate pudding: <br>Place the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and salt in a large, heavy saucepan (or clean, dry, and reuse the peanut butter pudding saucepan) and whisk to combine, making sure to break up any cocoa powder lumps. Slowly whisk in the milk, followed by the cream. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking frequently to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Boil, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 30 seconds. <br> Whisk in the chopped chocolate and boil, whisking frequently, until the chocolate is melted and the pudding thickens again, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla. Let cool for 5 minutes. Pour over the peanut butter pudding layer and smooth the surface with an offset spatula. Refrigerate uncovered for 2 hours. <br> <br>To decorate: <br>Decorate the 4 remaining Nutter Butter Cookies with icing to look like gravestones. Sprinkle the reserved fine chocolate cookie crumbs evenly over the surface of the chocolate pudding. Press the \u201cgravestones\u201d vertically into the pudding and make a pile of Nutter Butter cookie crumbs at the base of each. <br> Whip the remaining 1/2 cup cold cream and powdered sugar together until firm peaks form. Pipe or spoon piles of the whipped cream next to the gravestones and decorate with icing to look like ghosts. Serve with more whipped cream, if desired. <br> <br>Make ahead: <br>The puddings can be made one day ahead. After chilling uncovered for 2 hours, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to decorate. Store the processed cookie crumbs in separate airtight containers. <br> For a sweeter, more kid-friendly dessert, replace the dark chocolate with good-quality milk chocolate. <br> <br>Pudding recipes adapted from <br>Bon Appetit<br>.<br> ",

        "Recipe: Mini Apple Rose Pies",
        "<br> If you have been on Pinterest for any amount of time, you may have come across the trendy apple rose design seen on cupcakes, pies, tarts, and more. It\u2019s not hard to see the appeal of it, but I wanted to know: Is it really all that easy to do? <br> Yes, they are pretty easy to make \u2014 but you need to get a mandoline. <br> Sure, you can use a knife to thinly slice the apples, but you better make sure that it\u2019s razor-sharp and your patience reserve is full because it will be a laborious task compared to using a mandoline. You will want to make sure the apple slices are uniform in thinness for easy rolling \u2014 this means no thick corners or wavy cuts from sawing or stuttered slicing with a dull knife. <br> My favorite mandoline is the <br>Benriner vegetable slicer with tray<br>: it\u2019s not costly, it\u2019s easy to use, and it\u2019s easy to clean since there aren\u2019t many parts or grooves to dig food out of. The downside is that the hand guard is worthless, so to save my fingertips and keep my blood pressure steady while operating this bit of kitchen gadgetry, I always wear a no-cut glove. <br> Once you are done slicing, let the rolling begin. Put on some music and find your zen zone. Your first rose might not come out perfect, but trust me, it will still look like a rose. Here\u2019s my best tip for rolling: Use some finesse here; the more you try to force a tight roll, the more the apple slices will slip and wiggle around. You should roll and then stand it up on its bottom; with your hands encircling the rose, give it a quick tap on the flat surface you are working on and you\u2019ll see all the slices will uniformly fall into place. Now that the rose is formed and transferred into the pie crust, add in single slices of apples to fill out the center or outer part of the rose to your preference. <br> Lastly, here are just a few helpful notes about the ingredients. To really accentuate the rose \u201cpetals\u201d I added some red food coloring for a soft reddish tint. I used raspberry jam to quickly and easily pump up the flavor, but strawberry jam would work just as well. For the apples, I used Honeycrisp, but Gala or Fuji apples would work fine too. ",

        "How To Make Pommes Aligot (Cheesy Whipped Potatoes)",
        "<br> <br> Pommes Aligot<br> is more than just a cheesy twist on mashed potatoes. This incredibly magical blend of potatoes and cheese was born in the French region of Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, and it is a celebration of regional cheese, served on special occasions alongside sausage or roasted meat. It\u2019s traditionally made with <br>Tomme<br> de Laguiole<br> or <br>Tomme d\u2019Auvergne<br> cheese, although these fresh soft cheeses known for their melting qualities are pretty hard to find outside their tiny cities in the south of France. <br> While not as traditional, pommes Aligot can also be made with other melting cheeses like Gruy\u00e8re and mozzarella and doesn\u2019t require more than a strong arm for mixing and a hearty appetite. <br> French potatoes, much like French cheese, wine, and bread, are <br>prized for their flavor<br>. Early growing spring varieties are loved for their thin skin and fine texture. While French potato varieties are easily grown in your home garden and likely readily available from your local farmers markets, you\u2019ll have trouble finding these early growers into the fall. For pommes Aligot we\u2019re using Yukon Gold potatoes for their delicate texture and creamy, buttery flavor. <br> Peel, chop, and boil the potatoes as you would any potatoes for mashing, until tender. Instead of mashing with a hand-held potato masher, process the potato into a smooth pur\u00e9e quickly and efficiently in a few quick pulses of the food processor. <br> Have a ricer or food mill?<br> <br> Either of these tools would be ideal for pur\u00e9eing the potatoes to light and airy perfection. <br> To really understand the Aligot, you have to understand the Aveyron region of France. Situated in the South of France on the L\u2019Aubrac plateau, Aveyron (and specifically Laguiole, where Aligots namesake cheese hails from) are known for their cows. Aubrac cows are prized for their dairy. Aubrac milk is exceptionally nutty with a flavor often compared to hazelnut, and is used to make Laguiole cheese traditionally used in Aligot. <br> While pommes Aligot should really be made with <br>Tomme<br> de Laguiole<br> or <br>Tomme d\u2019Auvergne cheese<br>, both of these are hard to find outside of France. So instead, we\u2019re using a combination of Gruy\u00e8re for its melty texture and nutty flavor and fresh mozzarella. I\u2019ve had the best results with the tiny balls of fresh mozzarella that you can often find in the deli department of the grocery store. <br> Buy the best-quality cheese you can afford and be sure to stay away from the pre-shredded cheeses for this dish. <br> <br>Read more:<br> <br>A Cheesy Twist on Mashed Potatoes: Pommes Aligot<br> <br> You\u2019ll rarely see a photo of pommes Aligot that isn\u2019t a wooden spoon poised above the pot of potatoes with a long, luscious pull of cheesy potatoes between the two. This is as much an iconic photo moment as it is a good doneness indicator. Only when the cheese is fully incorporated and melty can you pull the pommes up out of the pot. Be prepared for the potatoes to lose the stringy magic as they cool. <br> You can keep pommes Aligot in slow cooker set to WARM if you want to serve your masterpiece of potatoes warm and with a little show of luxury for serving.

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Brisket and Onions",
        "<br> If you ask me about comfort food, I will answer promptly: slow-cooked brisket. This old-fashioned pot roast, cooked quietly in the slow cooker all day with just a handful of ingredients and a mess of caramelized onions, makes a rich broth and meat that melts in your mouth. Sunday dinner, weeknight supper \u2014 whenever you eat it, this is a classic dish both convenient and comforting. <br> My in-laws recently bought a whole cow share, divvying up the meat from this rather large beef cow among nearly a dozen friends and family. I put in a special request for the brisket, feeling just a little selfish as I nabbed this beautifully raised bit of meat. Brisket is my favorite cut of all. <br> When it comes to meat that\u2019s ideal for long, slow cooking, brisket is top of the heap. It comes from the front breastbone of the animal, and the muscles here support much of the weight of the cow, so there is quite a lot of connective tissue. Over long, slow cooking, these fibers are broken down and gelatinized. <br> The fat that forms a thick layer on some cuts of brisket, such as the one I cooked here, helps protect the meat from drying out. This fat can be kept in for a very luxurious dish, or removed. Fortunately it\u2019s easy to remove the fat, as brisket just improves with an overnight rest in the refrigerator. <br> I usually make brisket a day ahead, let it chill overnight, scrape away the hardened fat with a spoon (as seen above), then reheat gently in a covered dish in the oven. So convenient for potluck suppers and dinner parties, not to mention a few evenings of weeknight suppers. <br> It\u2019s all very soothing and hands-off and aromatic; for two days you\u2019ll have delivery men leaning a little further into your doorway, and dogs doing a double take as they trot by. <br> And it\u2019s not hard to get this going. Brisket has some of the richest natural flavor of any cut of meat. It needs very little other than a good sear, which helps concentrate the flavor, and a small mountain of lightly caramelized onions to give you something to spoon on top. For liquid, I cook the brisket in beef broth (although chicken broth will do fine) and a touch of Worcestershire and soy. Together they melt with the meat juices into a velvety rich sauce to spoon over thick slices of brisket. Comfort food is served. <br> <br>This recipe was originally published March 2008.<br> ",

        "How To Cook Acorn Squash: The Easiest, Simplest Method",
        "<br> A little olive oil, a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, some alone time in the oven \u2014 this is all that\u2019s between you and a warm dish of roasted acorn squash this evening. Here is a step-by-step recipe and guide to help you cook perfect acorn squash every time. <br> Acorn squashes aren\u2019t quite as tough and formidable as butternut squashes, but you need to use a chef\u2019s knife to cut this squash in half, or at least another heavy-duty knife that has some real heft to it. A paring knife is not going to do the trick. <br> Have your chef\u2019s knife? Okay, good \u2014 now the trick is to start on one side of the stem and cut straight through the squash (not the stem; don\u2019t even try to cut through the stem) until the knife stops meeting resistance and you\u2019ve cut through to the hollow middle. Continue cutting around the side of the acorn, through the tip, then around the other side, ending up on the other side of the stem. <br> Then, grab the squash with your big, strong hands, and pull it apart. As you pull apart the sides, the squash will split to one side of the stem. You can trim the stem out at this point, but I usually just leave it in. <br> Once you\u2019ve split the squash and scooped out the seeds (which you should definitely save <br>for roasting later<br>), then all that\u2019s left to do is rub the squash halves with a little olive oil or butter and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. <br> This makes a delicious meal all on its own, but you needn\u2019t stop at just the standard S&P. Try sprinkling on a few teaspoons of your favorite spice or mix of spices \u2014 <br>garam masala<br> is a favorite of mine. You could also add a scoop of brown sugar, or nestle a few garlic cloves into the bowl of each squash half. <br> Want to transform this simple side dish into a full-blown meal? Then stuff it! Leftover vegetables, shredded meat, a scoop of grains or some bread crumbs, and a little cheese \u2014 stuff all that in the bowl of the squash and roast away. Here\u2019s more info about how to get in on that squashy action: <br> Sure, this makes a great side dish, but once you have that acorn squash roasted, there are a surprising number of ways you can use it. <br> <br>Serves 2<br> <br> <br>Ingredients<br> 1 medium acorn squash<br> Olive oil or melted butter<br> Salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper <br> <br>Equipment<br> Chef\u2019s knife or other hefty knife<br> Spoon<br> Roasting pan or baking sheet <br> <br>Save your squash seeds and roast them! <br>Here\u2019s how: <br>How To Roast Pumpkin and Squash Seeds<br>.

        "How To Cook Perfectly Tender Lentils on the Stove",
        "<br> Dried lentils are a year-round staple in my pantry, essential for rounding out salads during hot weather and hearty soups in the winter months. Regardless of the season, their quick-cooking, no-soak-required nature makes them ideal for healthy weeknight meals. Worried about mushy lentils? I have a trick for that, too. <br> For weeknight meals, I like keeping green or brown lentils in our cupboard. These cook quickly and evenly without becoming mushy and are the most versatile for our recipes. <br>Yellow, red, and orange lentils<br> are fantastic, but since they tend to get mushy when cooked, they are usually best added to soups and sauces rather than cooked on their own. <br> It\u2019s also important to buy the freshest lentils you can find and then use them within a few months. Older lentils take longer to cook and tend to shed their skins during cooking. You may also see tiny white flecks where the lentil started to sprout. They\u2019re still tasty and entirely edible, but just not as presentation-worthy. <br> After trying many different cooking methods for lentils, I have found that the most reliable way to cook perfectly tender lentils is to bring them to a rapid simmer, then reduce the heat to low for the rest of cooking. You want to see just a few bubbles in the water and some gentle movement in the lentils. They will plump up nicely without splitting their skins or becoming mushy. <br> The other trick is to wait to add the salt or any acidic ingredients until the lentils are done cooking. These ingredients can cause the lentils to stay crunchy even when fully cooked. If you stir in the salt while the lentils are still warm, they will absorb just enough to taste fully seasoned. <br> Once cooked, your lentils are ready for any kind of culinary action you want to throw at them. They can be tossed into both green salads and grain salads, used in sandwich wraps, added to soups and chilis, or even made into veggie burgers. Some nights, I love a simple bowl of warm lentils tossed with good olive oil and vinegar with a poached egg to complete the meal. ",

        "How To Make Pumpkin Spice Lattes (Even Better than Starbucks!)",
        "<br> \u2018Tis the season. Can you hear the espresso machine firing up? Starbucks brought back its rockstar latte, the queen of froth, the obsession of millions \u2014 the Pumpkin Spice Latte. But if you don\u2019t want to drive to Starbucks and just fancy making it yourself at home, we have your back! <br> Here\u2019s how to make a spicy, frothy Pumpkin Spice Latte at home. It\u2019s so easy, and you\u2019ll have enough to share with someone you truly love. Don\u2019t skip the whip. <br> We\u2019d be remiss not to mention one more advantage of making the PSL at home: Our version actually has pumpkin in it. When we originally created this recipe, Starbucks\u2019 version of the PSL didn\u2019t contain any real pumpkin. (<br>Anjali\u2019s rant on the topic<br> was pretty epic.) Our recipe originated with Kathryn, a core writer in the early days of Kitchn. She included a touch of pumpkin for delicious and full-bodied pumpkin spice flavor. <br> An at-home PSL is also cheaper than those coffee shop drinks. As Kathryn says, \u201cFor those of us on a budget, those little cups of spicy goodness can add up. Making your own at home will not only save you money, but you can also enjoy them year-round. In addition, you have more control over the ingredients (especially the sugar), so you can tweak the recipe to your liking.\u201d <br> Especially if you like extra whipped cream. We won\u2019t tell. <br> I\u2019ve whipped up Kathryn\u2019s pumpkin spice concoction several times now, and I made some changes from the original recipe. First of all, I cook the pumpkin and the spices for a moment in the saucepan, which gets rid of any raw squash flavor and makes the spices toastier. Secondly, I think that the real key to this recipe is a healthy dose of black pepper, which cuts through the sweetness and the coffee for a spicy bite. And her rather startling amount of vanilla (yes, two tablespoons!) mimics the enhanced flavor of coffee shop syrups. Start with less if you want. Enjoy! <br> \u2014 <br>Faith<br>, August 2014<br> ",

        "How To Make Hasselback Apples",
        "<br> Meet Hasselback apples, the most impressive dessert you have to bake this fall. Crisps, crumbles, pies, and baked apples are all fine, but this is the one that <br>really<br> stands out in a crowd. <br> Firm, sweet apples open like a fan, allowing the cinnamon and brown sugar streusel to sink between each slice. Why not go all out and top this holiday-ready treat with a scoop of <br>vanilla ice cream<br>? <br> If you love baked apples, or any dessert that involves cooked apples for that matter, then Hasselback apples should be on your must-make list. They work just as well for a weeknight treat as they do for a dinner-party dessert. <br> When it comes to <br>baking apples<br> \u2014 especially with this dessert, where structure is so important \u2014 not every variety will work. Hasselback apples work best with very firm apple varieties, like Honeycrisp and Pink Lady. These apples are sturdy enough to hold their shape during baking, whereas other varieties \u2014 such as Cortland or McIntosh \u2014 will cook down too much during baking, leaving the thin apple slices to disintegrate and fall flat. The larger, the better. It\u2019s one more way to make this dessert even more impressive. <br> <br>Read more: <br>The Best Apples for Baking<br> <br> What makes this dessert really stand out are the slices over the top of the apple that cause it to fan out after baking. <br> For the best results, cut slices about 1/4-inch apart. Even very firm apples will cook down a little bit during baking, and when the slices are too thin, they begin to melt into each other, leaving the apple more droopy than fan-like. ",

        "How To Make French Press Coffee",
        "<br> There are a million ways to geek out over coffee. But in the end, what we\u2019re after is a hot, delicious cup of coffee to see us through the morning. A simple pleasure. <br> French press is one of the easiest, least expensive ways to make great coffee. Learn the essentials: here\u2019s how to make a pot of great French press coffee. <br> French press makes coffee by steeping the grounds in hot water, and then pressing the grounds out. <br> After the drip coffee maker, it\u2019s one of the easiest, least time-consuming ways to make a great cup of coffee. Also, unlike pour over and the Aeropress, it makes it easy to brew coffee for several people at once. But it is prone to bitterness and oiliness, since the coffee is sitting directly on the grounds for a period of time, and this can turn people off. <br> It took me a while to warm up to French press. I have been brewing it since shortly after college, when a roommate and her boyfriend gifted me my first French press and a little blade grinder. But, while I brewed it almost every day, I found it bitter and murky for my taste. Eventually I switched to the speedy Aeropress, which gives a clean, robust cup of coffee quickly. <br> But then I married a man who has this eerily amazing habit of bringing me coffee in bed. His brewing method of choice is the French press, and he won me over. It\u2019s not just having coffee in bed that has turned me into a devotee of French press (although of course that helps). Turns out that my method had been missing one key element all those years: The right grinder. <br> There are two things that really muck up French press coffee: <br>water temperature<br> \u2014 boiling water that scorches the grounds, or tepid water that doesn\u2019t extract fully \u2014<br> <br>and <br>badly ground coffee<br> with too much fine grit that makes the pressed coffee muddy and bitter. <br> These are the two factors that, to me, are most commonly ignored and yet easiest to remedy. All you need is a sense of how hot your water is and a burr grinder. <br> <br>\u2192 Takeaway: <br>Getting the temperature right is easy (just take the water off the boil and let it sit for a minute before brewing). <br> And then there\u2019s the grinder. There aren\u2019t many processes in the kitchen that truly depend on one gadget or tool, but good French press coffee is one of them. <br> Here\u2019s why. A regular blade grinder like <br>this one<br> is perfectly good for grinding coffee beans for a drip machine and other methods, but a French press relies on having very evenly-sized grains of coffee, and they need to be relatively big. Smaller-sized grains will get through the filter, creating a sediment in your cup, and also get over-extracted, making your coffee bitter. It\u2019s essential that all the coffee beans are ground to the same consistency and the burr grinder (<br>what\u2019s a burr grinder?<br>) is far superior at making this happen. <br> <br>\u2192 Takeaway: <br>If your French press turns out too bitter for you, or with a lot of gunky sediment at the bottom, then consider changing your grinder to a burr grinder. Or have your local coffee shop grind the coffee beans for you; their commercial grinders will do a great job as well. <br> If you don\u2019t have space for a burr grinder, then another brewing method might be better for you, like the Chemex or another pour over, or the Aeropress. More on these methods soon! <br> However, you can get a lot more technical and geeky than that over French press. Just take a look at the varying levels of instruction and minuscule attention paid to grams and brewing time at <br>Stumptown<br>, <br>Intelligentsia<br>, <br>Blue Bottle,<br> and <br>Serious Eats<br>. Whew. <br> Personally, I don\u2019t feel that one needs to quibble over 40 grams versus 36 grams of grounds to water, or whether you should weigh your beans and water rather than measuring them by volume. <br> I have a hunch that some of you will argue with me about that, but if you are Into Coffee, then there are a million things to twiddle all the time. That\u2019s part of the pleasure of coffee; like other things in cooking, you can improve and tweak to your heart\u2019s content, and find a lot of satisfaction in it. <br> But if you\u2019re just getting into French press, I think that this is the easiest method that includes the essentials but doesn\u2019t get too geeky. If you are more comfortable weighing your coffee and water than measuring by volume, go to it! If you are persnickety about how long to brew which roasts, have at it! I\u2019m right behind you. <br> But for now, let\u2019s just talk basics. Because in the end, it\u2019s just a cup of coffee, and I do hope that more of you will find your morning sustenance in a cup of French press, as it is really so delicious when done (mostly) right. <br> The instructions below make 32 ounces, a common size of French press that makes about four servings. But what if you want to make more or less? Here\u2019s a general guide to proportions by volume. Note that coffee beans are measured <br>before<br> grinding. <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the kitchen?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> <br> <br>Updated from post originally published April 2010.<br> ",

        "Recipe: Apple Yogurt Cake with a Cinnamon-Sugar Streak",
        "<br> My recipe stories seem to fall into a predictable rut: I had to feed a few people, and I needed something easy and simple, and so this recipe was born. But honestly, that\u2019s the way I cook. I look for recipes that give maximum pleasure at the lowest common denominator of work, ingredients, and convenience. The results aren\u2019t always worth talking about, but this recipe \u2014 oh, this one is. It\u2019s a moist cake with a crumb that\u2019s almost creamy, swirled with cinnamon, and juicy with small bites of apple. It will take you about 15 minutes to make, and regardless of whether my story gets old, this recipe never will. <br> This recipe materialized during a week of cooking for a group of scientists doing research in snowy Colorado. The first night we were there, I needed a quick, simple dessert. I had all the makings of a yogurt cake, like this <br>simple, favorite recipe<br>. But I had been craving spring\u2019s sweet fruits and berries. They were not really around yet, of course, but I wanted a bite of fruit. So I turned to apples. <br> Over-wintered apples are always available, and I love their mild sweetness and brightness when cut up very small and baked in a cake. They are juicy little pops of fruit. I also craved cinnamon, and so I spread a crumbly mix of cinnamon and brown sugar through the middle and over the top of this cake. This created a cinnamon streak running right through the cake, and a dimpled, puckered top filled with brown sugar glaze. <br> The beautiful thing about this cake, besides its moist lusciousness, is that it all mixes up in one bowl, and you don\u2019t even need beaters. It\u2019s only mildly sweet, too; much of the sweetness comes from the apples. <br> In fact, I came downstairs the morning after I made this and found only a corner or two remaining. My crew had evidently decided that this was good for breakfast as well, and attacked it with considered purpose. There were only a few moist crumbs left, two days later, but they were just as delicious as when I took the cake out of the oven. <br> This apple cake is not too sweet and goes perfectly with a hot mug of coffee or tea in the morning. Besides how easy it is to throw this together, I love that it\u2019s so moist it\u2019s almost like a bread pudding. I highly recommend using whole-milk yogurt here for the best flavor and texture. Also, metal cake pans bake faster than glass or ceramic pans, so check on your cake accordingly. Make sure to let it cool for one hour so that it has plenty of time to set up. <br> \u2013 <br>Christine<br>, October 2017 <br> ",

        "How To Make Puff Pastry Cheese Straws",
        "<br> Dinner party plans stressing you out? Puff pastry cheese straws are here for you. These crispy, flaky, cheesy twists require just two ingredients and a few minutes of your time, and yet they deliver big \u2014 real big \u2014 out on the buffet table. <br> Cheese straws are <br>made with puff pastry<br>, which is cut into strips and then twisted into \u201cstraws.\u201d This pastry is made of hundreds upon hundreds of thin layers of dough and butter. In the heat of the oven, these layers puff dramatically and become incredibly crispy. Add some cheese to those layers, and you\u2019ve got something worth spoiling your dinner over. <br> Cheese straws are just two ingredients: cheese and puff pastry. Don\u2019t overthink it! You can make the strips as long or as short, as thick or as thin, as twisty or as delicate as you like. A little extra cheese will also not throw anything off. You can even prep the straws and stash them in the fridge for an hour or so until you\u2019re ready to bake them, which is handy if you\u2019re juggling lots of tasks just before a dinner party. You can also bake them ahead, but they\u2019re best served within an hour or two of coming out of the oven. <br> Cheese straws are really an equal-opportunity appetizer. They go just as well with a glass of wine or a pint of beer. They can stand on their own (literally \u2014 you can serve them standing in a pretty cup!), but they\u2019re also great as part of a spread with things like pickles, deviled eggs, dips, and other nibbles.

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Boeuf Bourguignon",
        "<br> Boeuf bourguignon is so much more than just another beef stew. This classic French dish, made so popular by a certain Ms. Julia Child, is the kind of stew that moves you from one level of home cooking to the next. The aroma alone \u2014 the deeply savory scent of onions, slow-cooked beef, and red wine \u2014 is enough to make your eyes roll skyward and your knees go weak. Make boeuf bourguignon once and you\u2019ll wonder why anyone ever bothers making anything else. <br> Boeuf bourguignon is all about building flavor; layer upon layer upon layer of delicious flavor. Start with bacon \u2014 render all the bacon fat, then use the grease to sear the cubes of beef and cook the vegetables. Searing the beef and using a portion of the wine to deglaze the pan adds two more layers to the dish. After an afternoon of simmering (a method which is its own kind of flavor booster), the bacon bits and tender mushrooms get stirred into the stew for the grand finale. <br> The end result of all this careful attention is a stew of surpassing richness and complexity \u2014 a stew to impress a date, celebrate a winter birthday, or even serve up for Christmas. Choose your friends wisely when preparing them boeuf bourguignon, because you will likely find them at your door again next week with begging bowls in hand. <br> You can prepare boeuf bourguignon in the slow cooker or in a Dutch oven, both with excellent results. Either way, be prepared for a bit of prep work. This is not the kind of dish where the ingredients can be dumped together in a pot, but rather one that takes some time at the stove before you can \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d <br> When I make this in the slow cooker, I often prepare the meat and veggies the night before and then put everything in the slow cooker the next morning so they can simmer all day. When I prepare it in the Dutch oven, I start early so I can be sure it will be ready by dinner \u2014 or better yet, I make it the day ahead. The stew reheats well and is one of those dishes that tastes even better the second or third day. <br> Classically, boeuf bourguignon is finished with pearl onions as well as mushrooms. I think there\u2019s quite enough going on with this dish without either going to the trouble of preparing pearl onions myself, or falling back on frozen onions, so I skip them. This said, if you are a stickler for tradition or just love pearl onions, add a pound of them along with the mushrooms at the end of cooking. ",

        "Recipe: Ginger Pumpkin Pie with Graham Cracker Crust",
        "<br> Ah, pumpkin pie \u2014 that most quintessential of Thanksgiving desserts. Here\u2019s my own favorite take on pumpkin pie \u2014 one that skips the sometimes-finicky, sometimes-soggy pie crust for one made from crispy graham crackers. Add a heaping spoonful of fresh, piquant ginger and you have the pumpkin pie I look forward to all year long. <br> Pumpkin pie didn\u2019t used to be a favorite. I liked the flavor and spices of traditional pumpkin pie, but often found it unpleasantly soggy. Then, a few years ago, I wondered what it would be like made with a toasty, firmer graham cracker crust. Presto \u2014 delicious. The graham cracker crust is easier to shape and press into place than a regular pie crust (I always use a homemade graham cracker crust; the stor-ebought ones taste stale to me.) It also holds up underneath the custard filling of the pumpkin, staying toothsome and snappy. <br> Other crackers or cookies would also work well in this recipe. Gingersnaps would be lovely in the crust, or even chocolate wafers, if you\u2019re feeling daring! <br> And finally, a note on the ginger. I keep this pumpkin pie fairly classic, with a dash of spices, cream, and eggs. But I do add a large dose of fresh ginger as well. This will be surprisingly mild on the first day you taste this pie. But if you let it rest in the refrigerator overnight, or for two days, you will find that the ginger taste blooms beautifully and becomes a spicy note underneath the mellow pumpkin. For that reason, I do recommend making this pie at least a day ahead. <br> This is a pleasantly spicy, more grown-up take on the classic Thanksgiving pie since it\u2019s loaded with fresh ginger and black pepper. Use a deep-dish pie plate to accommodate all the rich, custardy pumpkin filling, but don\u2019t use a store-bought graham cracker crust, which won\u2019t be deep enough. Don\u2019t worry, though \u2014 a graham cracker crust is much easier to throw together than a regular pie crust. Just press and bake! <br> <br> \u2013 <br>Christine<br>, November 2018 <br> <br> <br>Related:<br> \u2022 <br>Recipe: Pumpkin Crumb Cakes<br> \u2022 <br>Technique: Pumpkin Puree<br> \u2022 <br>Honey Pumpkin Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e<br> \u2022 <br>Warm Pumpkin Salad with Polenta<br> ",

        "How To Make Easy Shredded Chicken in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> Behold the single food that has revolutionized my weekly meal plan! From tacos to salads to grain bowls, the simplicity and versatility of shredded chicken really can\u2019t be beat. Thanks to the slow cooker and a foolproof ratio, making a large quantity of shredded chicken at once is possible. Here\u2019s how you do it. <br> It doesn\u2019t get much easier or more versatile than slow cooker shredded chicken. It\u2019s a set-it-and-forget-it superstar, and requires just two ingredients. Start with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and your choice of water or chicken stock. I prefer stock, if I have it handy, because it adds a little more flavor, but water works equally well. Adding some liquid to the slow cooker is an essential step, and ensures that the chicken cooks up to be super tender and juicy. <br> Whether you\u2019re making just a few servings or enough to feed a crowd, the effort remains the same. The important thing to remember is keeping the right ratio of chicken to liquid. <br> <br>1/2 cup stock or water for every pound of chicken<br> <br> While this technique is super simple, the chicken doesn\u2019t actually fall apart into shreds on its own (wouldn\u2019t that be nice!). The most important thing to know is that it\u2019s best done when the chicken is still warm, preferably right after it\u2019s done cooking. Transfer the meat to a plate or cutting board and use two forks to pull it apart. The chicken will be so soft and tender that it will practically fall apart with just a little prodding. <br> As the chicken cools, the muscle fibers start to tighten up, which makes it a little tougher to shred. It\u2019s not impossible and it still works, but it takes some more effort and the meat tends to pull apart in larger chunks rather than thin, wispy shreds. <br> The very best thing about cooking up a batch of shredded chicken is all the possibilities it brings to mealtime. It can mean a week\u2019s worth of lunches \u2014 everything from wraps and burritos to a hearty grain bowl topping to a simple salad are made more satisfying with this protein topper. It\u2019s also an easy solution for weeknight dinners. When you have a staple like shredded chicken in the fridge, the possibilities are nearly endless. ",

        "Recipe: Pumpkin Magic Cake",
        "<br> Pumpkin custard magic cake is a new take on a Thanksgiving dessert that\u2019s chock-full of familiar flavors. Like <br>vanilla magic cake<br>, this is a unique treat with three layers of custardy dessert, all from a single batter. It\u2019s thick at the bottom, rich and custardy in the middle, and fluffy like a super-moist sponge cake on top, making it guaranteed to satisfy the pumpkin pie, pumpkin custard, and pumpkin cake lovers in your crowd. <br> Perhaps best of all for the cook, pumpkin custard magic cake has to be made in advance and refrigerated, leaving plenty of oven space. <br> This recipe is based on our cooking lesson for classic vanilla magic cake. But since it contains the added ingredient of pumpkin pur\u00e9e, there are two extra tips to be aware of. <br> <br>Makes 1 (8-inch) square cake<br> <br> <br>For the cake:<br> Cooking spray<br> 4 large egg yolks<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/8 teaspoon fine salt<br> 3/4 cup pumpkin pur\u00e9e (not pumpkin pie filling)<br> 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 7 large egg whites, at room temperature <br> <br>For the icing:<br> <br>1/2 cup powdered sugar<br> 2 to 3 teaspoons heavy cream or whole milk <br> <br>Make the cake: <br>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325\u00b0F. Coat an 8-inch square pan that is 2 inches deep with cooking spray. Cut 2 (8- by 12- to 16-inch) sheets of parchment paper. Press one sheet into the pan, leaving an overhang of at least 2 inches on either side. Press the second piece across the first, leaving overhangs on the other sides. These will be your \u201chandles\u201d when you take the cake out of the pan; set aside. <br> In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer or a whisk (and plenty of arm power), beat the egg yolks, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is a very pale yellow, 6 to 7 minutes. Do not undermix. <br> While keeping the speed at medium, drizzle in the melted butter and beat until well incorporated. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. <br> Add the flour, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and salt and mix on low speed until fully combined, stopping the mixer and scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed. Add the pumpkin and mix at medium speed until incorporated. Add the cream, milk, and vanilla and mix just until incorporated, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to medium speed. <br> Fit a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl. Strain the batter through it, using the back of the spoon to help push it through; set aside. <br> If you are using a handheld mixer or whisk, place the egg whites into a large clean, dry mixing bowl. If you are using a stand mixer, wash and dry the stand mixer bowl, fit the mixer with a clean whisk attachment, and place the whites into it. Whisk on low speed until foam begins to form, then increase the speed to high and whisk until the egg whites hold<br> stiff peaks<br>, about 2 minutes. <br> Add the whipped egg whites to the pumpkin batter and stir gently with a large spoon, making sure to leave a few fluffy lumps and clumps remaining. It should look like cottage cheese or scrambled eggs on top. Do not overmix or fold the egg whites in. <br> Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake until the edges are set, the top is golden-brown, and the center still wobbles and wiggles when the pan is jiggled, 60 to 65 minutes. <br> Let the cake cool to room temperature in the pan. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours before serving. <br> <br>Make the icing: <br>When ready to serve, make the icing. Place the powdered sugar in a small bowl. Add the milk or cream 1 teaspoon at a time, mixing well after each addition, until it is the texture of glue. Use the parchment sling to pull the cake from the pan. Discard the parchment paper. Using a small spoon, drizzle the icing decoratively over the top of the cake. Cut into squares and serve. ",

        "Recipe: Pumpkin Spiced Peanut Butter Cups",
        "<br> These homemade peanut butter cups are pretty much a slam dunk. I mean, could it get any better? They\u2019re two-bite chocolate treats with a nugget of creamy pumpkin-spiced peanut butter in the middle. This is Halloween candy for kids, grown-ups, and everyone in between. <br> Ariel special-requested these cups for her <br>Spooky Colorful Halloween Party<br>, and reports that they were a major hit. Pumpkin spice wins again! She used <br>these Halloween cupcake papers<br> from Crate & Barrel as the molds, and trimmed down the sides to better show off the candies. <br> These Halloween-y treats are an easy riff on my basic recipe for <br>Homemade Peanut Butter Cups<br>. I just bumped up the amount of filling to make these extra-gooey and added a dash of pumpkin spice. Because: pumpkin spice. <br> To make them even more fun for autumn, I gave each peanut butter cup a dollop of pumpkin butter before adding the final coating of chocolate. You can skip this if you like\u2026but I wouldn\u2019t. <br> One note \u2014 definitely set aside an afternoon to make these cups. They\u2019re not that complicated, but the process of melting the chocolate, letting it set, and so on takes some time. If you\u2019re making these for a party, you can make them several days ahead and keep them in an airtight container in a cool part of your house. <br> Go on! Make yourself a batch. Just be sure to have a few friends nearby so you aren\u2019t tempted to eat them all yourself. <br> <br>Makes 22 to 24 <br> <br> 3/4 cup peanut butter or other nut butter<br> 1/2 cup powdered sugar<br> 1 teaspoon pumpkin spice mix, plus more to taste<br> 1 pound good-quality dark chocolate or milk chocolate, chopped if purchased as a block<br> 1/2 cup pumpkin butter, optional <br> \u2192 <br>For detailed step-by-step instructions with photos: <br>How To Make Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups<br> <br> <br> Combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and pumpkin spice mix in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 15 to 20 times until the mixture is dry and crumbly. It should hold together in a ball when pressed and feel moldable but no longer creamy; add more powdered sugar if needed. Taste and add more pumpkin spice in 1/2 teaspoon portions to taste. <br> Transfer the peanut butter filling to a clean bowl, cover, and keep chilled in the refrigerator until ready to use. <br> Melt 1/3 of the chocolate in a double-boiler or a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Let the chocolate stand without stirring until nearly melted, then stir until smooth. Transfer the melted chocolate to your workspace. <br> While the chocolate is melting, arrange 24 muffin cup liners on a baking sheet. Once the chocolate has melted, use a spoon to scoop up a small amount of chocolate and drizzle it into the cup liners. Use the back of the spoon to gently smooth the chocolate into a thin layer (roughly 1/8-inch thick, but no need to get exact about it!) on the bottom of the cup. Repeat with all the remaining liners. <br> Let the chocolate set until hardened. If your house is chilly, the first cups will already be setting by the time you finish the last ones. To speed things along, you can place the cups in the fridge for a few minutes. Wait until the chocolate is firm before continuing with the next steps. <br> While the chocolate is setting, begin preparing the filling. Scoop up 2 teaspoons of filling and shape them into thick disks with your fingers. The disks should be nearly the diameter of the cup with just a little space left around the edge. Once the chocolate has set, place one disk of filling in the middle of each cup. Dollop about a teaspoon of pumpkin butter over the top of each disk. <br> Melt the remaining chocolate over a double-broiler or in a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Let the chocolate stand without stirring until nearly melted, then stir until smooth. Transfer the melted chocolate to your workspace. <br> Scoop a generous spoonful of chocolate over the peanut butter filling in each cup. Use the back of the spoon to gently spread the chocolate around the filling and smooth the top. The chocolate should completely cover the filling. If the chocolate starts to thicken too much to easily work with, set it back over a double-boiler until pourable again. <br> Set the tray of peanut butter cups somewhere cool until the chocolate has fully set and the tops are dry, then you can transfer the candies to a container for storage. Remove the paper wrappers before serving. ",

        "How To Cook Brown Rice",
        "<br> Knowing how to cook a good pot of brown rice is an essential kitchen skill. I\u2019m talking about tender, chewy brown rice that goes equally well with a quick stir-fry as it does with slices of roasted chicken. Forget the crunchy or mushy stuff that you may have suffered through in the past \u2014 we\u2019ve got our method locked down. It\u2019s time to discover how great brown rice can be. <br> Look for medium- or long-grain brown rice. (Short-grain brown rice cooks slightly differently, so skip it for this method.) <br> Uncooked brown rice can be stored in the cupboard, but is best used within a few months of purchasing. If you don\u2019t cook with brown rice very often, storing it in the fridge will help keep it fresh for longer. If you have an open bag of rice, or if you bought your rice from a bulk bin, transfer it to an airtight container for storing. <br> If you\u2019ve had some brown rice sitting in the back of your cupboard for more than a year, it\u2019s probably best to toss it and pick up a fresh bag. The oils in the rice go rancid over time and can make the rice taste overly bitter and unpalatable. <br> Rinsing your rice before cooking it washes away any grit or dust that may have gotten mixed in during production. I also find that rinsing helps improve the texture of the rice; it\u2019s less crucial than rinsing white rice, but still helps to make each grain distinct. <br> Toasting the rice won\u2019t change its texture, but it gives the rice a more deeply nutty, toasted flavor. Just saut\u00e9 the rice in a little olive oil before adding the water, and stir until the rice smells fragrant and you can see a touch of golden color here and there. This is a totally optional step, but if the earthy flavor of brown rice is what has kept you from eating it in the past, then you might find that you like brown rice better after toasting. <br> And finally, after cooking, let your rice rest off the heat with the lid on for about 10 minutes. This pause before serving helps the rice absorb the last of the moisture in the pot. If you skip it, the rice can be a little sticky and gummy when scooping it from the pot instead of light and fluffy. <br> Brown rice is truly a kitchen staple \u2014 willing and able to be used in all sorts of ways. It\u2019s a side dish on its own, the base of a grain bowl or an easy lunch salad, a filling for burritos, or the start of a casserole. I often make a double batch for dinner and keep the leftovers in the fridge to use up during the week. <br> Since brown rice takes some time to cook, I also <br>freeze bags of cooked grains<br> for nights when I don\u2019t have time to cook a fresh batch. It\u2019s an easy way to make sure I always have some grains on hand when I need them. ",

        "Recipe: Fish Tacos with Quick Cabbage Slaw",
        "<br> I always forget how good, healthy, and easy fish tacos are until I make them and vow to do it more often. They\u2019re remarkably adaptable to any type of not-too-expensive fish you might find in your local market. You can use any kind of white fish fillet, like sole, snapper, catfish, or tilapia. I prefer saltwater species, but sometimes the freshwater farmed fish are more economical. <br> The textural contrast between lightly crispy fish, supple corn tortillas, and soft avocado is a big part of this simple recipe\u2019s success. <br> I always imagined fish tacos would be a fussy, messy affair, perhaps involving deep-frying or the necessity of a grill \u2014 certainly nothing I could just decide to make on a whim and pull together on a weeknight. <br> I was so wrong! The fish for these tacos is incredibly simple to prepare. It\u2019s dredged in flour and pan-fried for a few minutes on the stovetop \u2014 literally, minutes. The whole meal was so fast and easy that I smacked myself for not trying it sooner. <br> I used fillet of sole because that\u2019s what the fish vendor at my farmers market recommended \u2014 although the vendor said she preferred rockfish for tacos when she can get it. Really, any flaky white fish will work here \u2014 I\u2019ve added a few options to the ones Vanessa originally listed. <br> If you, too, have never made fish tacos at home because you thought they\u2019d be tricky to pull off, wait no longer \u2014 this meal is a keeper. <br> \u2013 <br>Emma<br>, March 2014<br> <br> <br>Serves 4 (about 3 tacos per person)<br> <br> <br>For the slaw<br>:<br> 4 cups shredded cabbage<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 small carrot, grated<br> 2 to 3 medium scallions, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 to 1 whole jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and minced (optional)<br> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice<br> 2 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> Sugar, honey, or agave nectar (optional)*<br> Freshly ground black pepper <br> <br>For the fish<br>:<br> 1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper<br> 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika or chipotle powder<br> 1 to 1 1/2 pounds snapper, sole, tilapia, rockfish, or catfish fillets<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br> <br>For serving:<br> <br>  <br>   12 corn tortillas  <br> Torn cilantro leaves<br> Sliced avocado<br> Lime wedges<br> Salsa <br> <br> Make the slaw:<br> Place the cabbage in a colander or strainer and sprinkle with the salt. Massage and squeeze the cabbage with your hands to help it release its liquid and begin wilting. Place in the sink or over another bowl, and set aside to drain for about 15 minutes. <br> Using your hands, squeeze the cabbage of its excess liquid one handful at a time, and transfer to a large bowl. Add the carrot, scallions, and jalape\u00f1o if using. Toss to combine. Add the mayonnaise, lime juice, and garlic and toss to combine. Taste and season with a sweetener, salt, or pepper as needed. <br> <br>Make the fish: <br>Combine the flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a shallow container. Pat the fish dry with paper towels, then dredge it in the flour mixture until evenly coated. <br> Heat the oil in a heavy (preferably cast iron) pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the fish in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Cook undisturbed until golden-brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a flat spatula, carefully flip the fish, but don\u2019t worry if it falls apart a bit. Continue cooking until the second side is golden brown and the fish is opaque and flakes apart easily in the thickest part, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the fish to a clean plate and flake into large chunks; keep warm. <br> Heat the corn tortillas, one by one, in a heavy, dry pan, until soft and warm. Wrap them in a clean kitchen towel as you go. (Alternatively, wrap them in a clean kitchen towel and warm them in the microwave for a few seconds.) <br> Serve the fish with the tortillas, slaw, cilantro, avocado, lime, and salsa on the side, letting each diner assemble his or her own tacos. These tacos are made and eaten immediately. ",

        "Recipe: Canadian-Syrian Thanksgiving Stuffing",
        "<br> This recipe, created with my friend \u2014 the mother of a <br>Syrian refugee family we hosted<br> \u2014 takes a classic Thanksgiving stuffing and adds a Syrian twist. Commonly used celery is replaced by roasted chestnuts, and golden raisins are mixed with cranberries \u2014 but the tender pillow of soft bread remains. The result is a deliciously smoky-yet-sweet stuffing any turkey would love to be next to. <br> This stuffing starts with all the typical players you\u2019d expect in a traditional stuffing \u2014 a saut\u00e9ed onion, dried bread, and just enough butter \u2014 but instead of using the spices and herbs often associated with this dish, we\u2019re going with a combination of warm spices frequently used in Middle Eastern cuisine. <br> This spice mix, know as bharat, is widely used throughout Syria. The formula uses seven different spices \u2014 allspice, black pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, and cloves \u2014 and can be purchased pre-mixed or mixed at home and adjusted according to taste. Consider the amounts below a good starting point as a fragrant and delicious place to start. <br> <br>Serves 8<br> <br> 1 loaf unsliced white bread (about 1 1/2 pounds), crusts removed, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 12 cups)<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine<br> 1 medium yellow onion, diced<br> 1 teaspoon coarse salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1/2 cup golden raisins<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries<br> 1/2 cup coarsely chopped roasted chestnuts (about 100 grams)<br> 2 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth <br> Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 350\u00b0F. Divide the bread between 2 baking sheets and spread into an even layer. Bake until dry and light golden-brown, stirring halfway through, 10 to 15 minutes total; set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0F. <br> Once cooled, transfer the bread to a large bowl. Add the raisins, cranberries, and chestnuts and stir to combine; set aside. <br> Melt the butter or margarine over medium heat in a small saucepan. Add the onion and cook until soft and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the salt, allspice, pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, and cloves. Cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, about 2 minutes. <br> Transfer the mixture to the bowl of bread, add the broth, and stir until well-combined. Transfer the stuffing to a 9\u00d713-inch baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until the top is golden-brown and crispy, about 15 minutes more. ",

        "How To Make Hummus from Scratch",
        "<br> I\u2019m fairly convinced that hummus is some of the best stuff on earth. It might look beige and boring in the bowl, but this blend of chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic creates a dip that is so much more than the sum of its parts. <br> Skip the store-bought stuff \u2014 making it yourself is so easy and will be far tastier than just about anything from the deli section. <br> Hummus is a Middle Eastern invention, and I am thankful for it. Chickpeas are a sweet and nutty legume that become incredibly creamy when blended, especially once you add a few spoonfuls of sesame tahini and a healthy glug of good olive oil. Lemon juice gives the blend a tart balance, while garlic adds its own pungent punch. It\u2019s fantastic with just these five ingredients (plus salt and pepper), but can be even better with spices like sumac, cumin, and smoked paprika. <br> The hummus we\u2019re making here uses canned chickpeas, which are readily available, easily stored for spur-of-the-moment hummus cravings, and also surprisingly good. This said, hummus made from chickpeas that you cook yourself is a beautiful thing. If you have the time and inclination, I encourage you to try it. You\u2019ll need about two cups of cooked chickpeas for this recipe (roughly 1/3 pound dried chickpeas). <br> Hummus is more of an idea than a recipe \u2014 this is my favorite version, but there is lots of room for others. Play around with the proportions, add some spices, and make this recipe your own. <br> <br>For <br>even<br> smoother hummus: <br>If you love super-smooth hummus, it\u2019s also worth taking the time to pinch the skins from each chickpea. This is a time-consuming endeavor, no question, but hummus made with these chickpeas is smooth as silk. <br> <br>Tahini & its substitutes: <br>Tahini is one ingredient you might not have in your pantry. In a pinch, you can substitute other nut butters, but there\u2019s something about the earthy, slightly bitter taste of tahini made from sesame seeds that adds that little \u201csomething\u201d to hummus. Stored in the fridge, a big jar of tahini will last for quite some time, so you don\u2019t have to worry about using it up right away. Along with hummus, tahini is also fantastic in salad dressings, sauces for grilled foods, and as a spread on sandwiches. <br> Deli containers of store-bought hummus are always a disappointment \u2014 over-salted, a little too coarse, and never worth the price tag. It just makes sense to make hummus at home. I made this batch of hummus using my go-to brand of chickpeas, Goya. These canned legumes have a beautifully creamy texture, but most importantly they remain intact in the can, which is essential when pinching skins is the first step of the procedure. <br> I wondered at first if this step was truly worth it, in the end deciding to remove the skins and choosing the shortcut of canned beans rather than cooking dried beans to account for the extra work. For even smoother hummus, I increased the processing time to five minutes and thinned the dip with some of the reserved chickpea liquid (aquafaba) rather than adding more lemon juice and olive oil to maintain the balance of flavors. <br> \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, May 2018 ",

        "<br> The combination of bacon, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes is always a win, no matter what you do with them (<br>Brussels and pork<br> are meant to be together). But I added some grainy mustard just to make things more interesting. This is the perfect side dish for a cold evening! <br> This recipe is a variation on one that a family member has made for me before, which is just potatoes and bacon. Simple ingredients, but the ingenious part is in the execution: You don\u2019t cook the bacon beforehand. Just throw it in raw, and as it crisps, the rendered fat coats and flavors the vegetables. <br> I love the touch of mustard, a little tang that goes surprisingly well with the sprouts, too. The only thing you have to think about is giving the bacon and potatoes a head start in the oven, since the Brussels sprouts take less time to cook. You want your potatoes to be pretty tender (a fork should go in without too much force) before you add the sprouts. And the smaller you dice your bacon, the crispier it\u2019ll be. <br> This has long been one of the most popular side dish recipes in our recipe collection, and understandably so. It has all the hallmarks of a recipe from Elizabeth: comfort food flavors in a rather brilliantly simple little package. <br> I did make a few changes when retesting this. I feel that mixing the Brussels in with the potatoes didn\u2019t create as crispy of a potato (or as browned of a sprout) as I like. So I push the potatoes to one side of the pan and the sprouts to the other as they cook, which lets each get browned and crispy without steaming the other up. <br> I also have you crank up the oven heat in the last 15 minutes as the sprouts go in, which, again, contributes to nicely browned and flavorful vegetables that still retain some bite in the center. <br> \u2014 <br>Faith<br>, December 2014<br> ",

Using a flat or offset spatula, transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and let cool completely before decorating and storing.",

        "How To Make Perfect Pumpkin Muffins",
        "<br> I recently read an article that mentioned most people are satisfied with one Pumpkin Spice Latte every fall. Just one. The same cannot be said for soft, lightly spiced pumpkin muffins. These breakfast treats are especially wonderful right now, as we settle into autumn, but are also perfectly acceptable to eat year-round. <br> A big part of what makes pumpkin muffins so amazing is the spice blend that gives them their warm flavor. The blend of spices used in this recipe are also the primary components of <br>pumpkin pie spice<br>: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves. Rather than using a store-bought spice blend, I really prefer to use the individual spices so I can adjust the amount of spices to my taste. <br> <br>Read more: <br>How To Make Pumpkin Pie Spice<br> <br> When picking up the ingredients for these muffins, be sure to grab plain pumpkin pur\u00e9e, not pumpkin pie filling \u2014 they\u2019re not quite the same thing. Canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e is simply that, cooked and pur\u00e9ed pumpkin; it has very little flavor and isn\u2019t sweetened. Canned pumpkin pie filling, on the other hand, is sweetened and flavored with spices; it\u2019s essentially a shortcut to making pumpkin pie. Check the label on the can before you buy as it\u2019s super easy to grab the wrong one off the shelf. <br> <br>More on pumpkin pur\u00e9e: <br>What\u2019s Actually In Your Canned Pumpkin Pur\u00e9e?<br> <br> This version of pumpkin muffins is a standard classic. They\u2019re simple, yet pillowy-soft, fluffy, and ultra-comforting. If you prefer your muffin chock full of add-ins, this recipe makes a great base. Go ahead and add anything from chocolate chips to walnuts to raisins to shredded coconut. ",

        "How To Clean and Roast Pumpkin Seeds",
        "<br> The real gift of pumpkin season is what\u2019s hiding inside: the (all-too-often-discarded) seeds. When toasted in the oven with a little olive oil and some salt, the soft seeds from inside pumpkins turn into the crunchiest, savory snack of the season. They certainly make sticking your hand inside a squishy pumpkin worth the hassle, anyway. Here\u2019s the simplest, easiest method for cleaning pumpkin seeds and roasting them in the oven. <br> It\u2019s not necessary to remove every last scrap of pumpkin flesh from the seeds. Pick the seeds out of the pumpkin with clean hands and move them to a bowl of water. Soak the seeds briefly, working the seeds back and forth to dislodge stringy bits of pumpkin. <br> Some people hardly bother removing any of the strings and extras from the seeds, stating that it tastes great roasted and adds additional flavor to the seeds; others remove every last shred, which admittedly is a chore. I come in somewhere in the middle. I get most of the flesh and strings off, but I don\u2019t get too obsessive about it. If I did, I doubt that I would roast seeds ever again because it can be quite nit-picky! <br> <br>You\u2019ve got to read the whisk tip in the comments: <br>The Best Tool for Removing Pumpkin and Squash Seeds<br> <br> Take the simple approach and just toss the cleaned seeds in a little oil and salt before roasting. There is also a wide variety of additional toppings you can add, both savory and sweet, to jazz things up. See recipe notes for some suggestions. <br> Pumpkin seeds are good for you, too: They\u2019re high in protein, zinc, copper, and iron. They\u2019re a good source of Vitamin E and K. (Here\u2019s <br>a good page<br> showing their complete nutritional breakdown.) Some people believe that soaking them overnight in salted water, or boiling them for 10 minutes in salted water, helps to make their nutrition more available and to make them crunchier when roasted. But either way, you\u2019re guaranteed a tasty treat. ",

No, you needn\u2019t be a rosy-cheeked child to indulge. In fact, join us this happy hour for a mug of spiked (or not!) hot cocoa that everyone will love. <br> Whether you\u2019re looking for the Best Mom on the Block award, wanting to warm the heart of your honey, or are simply treating yourself, this hot sip does the trick. <br> Nutella, for anyone who hasn\u2019t yet had the pleasure, is a creamy chocolate-hazelnut spread. My kids love it with peanut butter, or in place of it, on PB&Js. I\u2019ve even concocted a fab appetizer by spreading it on thinly sliced baguette and topping it with pieces of dried chorizo. Now I\u2019m mixing it with milk and putting it on the stove for a dreamy, sweet, hot cocktail. <br> Toasted marshmallows are the perfect topping. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 you can get that campfire feeling without heading outdoors. Simply place your marshmallows on a foil-lined baking sheet under the broiler for 30 to 45 seconds for perfect golden brown, gooey, toasted marshmallows. <br> The recipe below has a non-alcoholic version that\u2019s perfect for the kiddos, and I\u2019ve also included a big batch if you\u2019re entertaining the neighbors.

        "How To Make Awesome Pizza at Home",
        "<br> Pizza is a regular visitor to our house \u2014 only it doesn\u2019t usually come from a delivery person. Making homemade pizza from prepared dough is a quick and easy dinner any night of the week. Even <br>making your own dough<br> only really adds a few minutes to the prep time! Pile on your favorite toppings and get ready to chow down. <br> Yes, you can buy pretty decent pizza dough from the bakery counter at your grocery store, but why bother when you can easily mix up a batch at home for pennies? Use any one of our pizza dough recipes to get started. <br> While the rise time on most of these is relative short (one to two hours), you can mix the dough the night or morning before and let the dough rise slowly all day. Be sure to bring the dough to room temperature for an hour before shaping. <br> My favorite method for shaping the pizza is to roll the dough onto a piece of parchment paper. The dough sticks to the parchment, making it easier to work with and easier to transfer into the oven. The pizza will release from the parchment during cooking and the parchment can be removed halfway through cooking. The parchment darkens in the oven, but doesn\u2019t burn or catch fire. <br> When it comes to red sauce, trust us when we say a simple, no-cook blender sauce is best. Pesto or rich ricotta are wonderful substitutes as well. <br> <br>There are also no rules about the kinds of toppings you put on your pizza. Choose ones you love. They will cook a little in the oven, but if it isn\u2019t something you like to eat raw, like sausage or mushrooms, cook them ahead of time. If you\u2019d like fresh greens or herbs (like arugula or basil) on your pizza, sprinkle them over the pizza right when it comes out of the oven. The residual heat from the pizza will wilt the greens just slightly and bring out their flavor. <br> It\u2019s best, though, to keep the toppings to just a handful at most. If you load homemade pizza down with a ton of toppings, it may take too long for the crust to cook. <br> Don\u2019t be afraid to really crank the heat up to its highest setting. The high heat will help make a crunchier and more flavorful crust. Let the oven heat for at least half an hour before baking your pizzas. If you have a baking stone or steel, place it in the lower-middle of your oven. (Or you can invert a baking sheet in the oven as a sort of pseudo pizza stone.) <br> Baking on parchment paper will make loading and unloading the pizza from the oven easier, but you can also use flour or cornmeal to keep the pizza from sticking to a pizza peel or additional inverted baking sheet for building the pizza on. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>Want the Best Homemade Pizza? You Have to Turn Up the Heat.<br> ",

        "<br> There are countless apple cakes in Germany, but this one, in which a rather plain batter rises up and bakes around sliced apples, has to be one of the most popular. Cakes like these are often called <br>Mittwochskuchen<br> (Wednesday cakes) because they can easily be made during the week when time is short. <br> Various regions of Germany try to lay claim to this cake by changing its name to reflect their geography, but it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s a countrywide favorite. And no wonder \u2014 it\u2019s great for people who are new to baking and it\u2019s relatively wholesome, with a high apple-to-cake ratio. <br> Slicing the apple quarters almost all the way through guarantees that they\u2019ll cook through in the same amount of time that the relatively thin batter takes. A light sprinkling of raw sugar on top gives each piece a pleasing crunch. It is practically mandatory in Germany to serve this type of cake with a dollop of<br> schlagsahne<br>, or lightly <br>sweetened whipped cream.<br> ",

        "How To Roast Any Vegetable",
        "<br> I am a firm believer in the power of a roasted vegetable. Not only can virtually every vegetable be cooked in this way \u2014 no recipe required \u2014 but roasted vegetables are also universally pleasurable to eat. Have a picky eater in the house? Want a break from your usual steamed veggie side dish? Try roasting your broccoli or green beans or cauliflower tonight. I think you\u2019re in for a treat. <br> Root vegetables \u2014 like potatoes, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and carrots \u2014 are old standbys when it comes to roasting, of course, but take a look through your crisper drawer and you\u2019ll find all sorts of roasting candidates \u2014 from crucifers like broccoli and Brussels sprouts to surprises like zucchini, onions, bell peppers, and cabbage. Even tomatoes <br>can be roasted<br>. <br> If you\u2019re not sure if a particular vegetable can be roasted, my recommendation is to just give it a try. It might not end up being your favorite way to eat that vegetable, but it\u2019s definitely worth the experiment to find out. <br> Once you\u2019ve cut your vegetables down into bite-sized pieces, toss them with some good-tasting oil. Use enough to give the vegetables a slick, glossy coating, but not so much that you have puddles in the bottom of your bowl \u2014 a tablespoon or two will usually get the job done. Not only does the oil help the vegetables cook more evenly and crisp up in the oven, but it also adds a rich flavor that makes roasted vegetables irresistible. <br> I usually use a mild olive oil when roasting vegetables, but you could also use coconut oil, avocado oil, or any other oil you like to use. Also, I usually toss the vegetables with my hands so I can rub the oil into the vegetables and make sure they\u2019re evenly coated. <br> Last but not least, toss your vegetables with some salt. You can add black pepper or any other seasonings, as well. Again, be generous, but not excessive \u2014 add enough salt and other seasonings so that each piece of vegetable gets a little. <br> Spread the vegetables out onto a baking sheet. You want to see a bit of space around the veggies \u2014 don\u2019t be afraid to split them between two baking sheets if you need to. Crowding will make the vegetables steam instead of roast, and that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re going for. <br> Also, make sure your oven is good and hot before you put the vegetables in to roast. I think around 425\u00b0F is ideal for roasting most vegetables, although you can adjust up or down as you prefer. <br> Roast until the vegetables are tender enough to pierce with a fork and you see some charred bits on the edges. Softer vegetables cook more quickly, while harder vegetables like potatoes will cook more slowly. Smaller pieces will also cook more quickly than larger pieces. If you\u2019re roasting a new-to-you vegetable, start checking after about 15 minutes, and keep roasting until you see charred bits. <br> Those charred bits are what make roasted vegetables so good, so even if the vegetables are already tender and cooked through, keep roasting until you see the vegetables start to turn toasty around the tips and edges. If in doubt, roast an extra five or 10 minutes \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely the extra roasting will hurt, and very likely that your vegetable will be even tastier. <br> If you\u2019d like to make a mixed-vegetable side dish, you have three options. <br> Cooking times are for roasting vegetables at 425\u00b0F. <br> <br> <br>This post has been updated \u2014 first published November 2009. <br> <br> ",

        "How To Make Roasted Pork Tenderloin",
        "<br> If you\u2019re in the mood for a simple dinner of meat and vegetables, but need to shake up your <br>chicken breast<br> (or <br>pork chop<br>) routine, pork tenderloin is your ticket. Pork tenderloin is one of the easiest, most relaxed cuts of meat to cook for dinner, and it\u2019s one of my favorite weeknight meals. There\u2019s no major preparation involved; just season and bang into the oven while you make a salad. <br> Here\u2019s our best method for making tender, juicy pork tenderloin that tastes so good it may just earn a spot in your weekly meal rotation. <br> As Christine explains in her <br>guide to buying pork chops<br>, the tenderloin comes from the loin of the pig, which runs from the hip to the shoulder. The tenderloin itself is sometimes also called a pork \u201cfilet,\u201d and it is one of the most tender cuts of meat on the animal, since it is not a muscle that receives much, if any, exercise. <br> This means that the tenderloin is usually a little more expensive than cuts of meat that need longer cooking, like the loin proper or pork butt (shoulder). It also means that it can be cooked quickly and easily, with no brining or braising needed. <br> Pork tenderloin is often sold in individual packages in the meat section of the grocery store. An individual tenderloin isn\u2019t very much meat; it usually weighs about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds. So you\u2019ll often find <br>two <br>tenderloins in one package. If you come home with two, just cook both. Leftovers keep beautifully and are great in sandwiches. Or freeze one, if two is more than you can eat within a few days. <br> Pork tenderloins are also often sold packaged in a marinade. Personally, I avoid these, as I would prefer to season the meat myself (and control the amount of salt and oil used). It\u2019s very quick and easy to roll a pork tenderloin in some salt and spices, or to create a paste of garlic and ginger to rub all over it. <br> The method below is our favorite way to cook a pork tenderloin, and it\u2019s very easy. The only way to make it easier would be to not flip the meat while it\u2019s cooking, but that one extra step creates a delicious crust on the meat and cooks it more evenly. <br> Pork tenderloin is usually fairly lean, so it\u2019s important to not overcook it. It can quickly turn from tender and juicy to dry and chewy, so check the internal temperature and remove the pork from the pan as soon as the meat registers <br>140\u00b0F to 145\u00b0F<br> in the thickest part of the meat. It\u2019s perfectly normal and fine for the pork to be a little pink inside, as long as it has reached the correct temperature in the thickest part of the meat. <br> Once you\u2019ve mastered this method, try one of these other recipes too!

        "How To Cook Spaghetti Squash in the Oven",
        "<br> So you took a gamble on a spaghetti squash \u2014 it <br>does<br> have a pretty clever <br>sales hook<br>, after all \u2014 but now you\u2019re staring at this canary-yellow gourd wondering how on earth it could ever be transformed into anything resembling pasta. You\u2019re full of doubts and hopes and perhaps a dash of healthy skepticism. I get that. <br> Well, buckle up, because today we\u2019re pulling some culinary alchemy and transforming squash into tender tangles of spaghetti \u2014 no spiralizers or any special gadgets required. You just need an oven and a half-hour of your time. <br> The number-one question you want answered before heading into this, right? The answer is yes \u2026 and also no. Once cooked, the yellow flesh of this squash will separate into long strands that you can, indeed, top with marinara sauce and twirl around your fork. The texture is like angel hair pasta \u2014 it\u2019s tender and chewy, but a bit fragile. <br> Now for the \u201c\u2026and also no\u201d news: Even though a miracle of Mother Nature has given this squash some spaghetti-like attributes, it is still a squash. It looks like pasta and has a texture like pasta, but it\u2019s still probably not going to fool anyone. The flavor is very mild (you might even call it bland) with none of that sweet, earthy, squash-like flavor we associate with butternut and acorn squash. This makes spaghetti squash the perfect companion for something like a hearty ragu or a curry \u2014 the squash\u2019s flavor won\u2019t compete with the main attraction on the plate \u2014 but you still get all that great spaghetti-like texture. <br> <br>Read more about it here: <br>Nature\u2019s Little Joke on Pasta: Spaghetti Squash<br> <br> Like all winter squash, spaghetti squash requires some time in the oven before it becomes tender enough to eat. The quickest way to get this side dish on the table is to cut the squash in half and cook it face-down in a baking dish. I like to add a little water to the pan or cover it with foil to help things along; the steam helps keep surfaces of the squash from drying out and makes the resulting strands of squash incredibly tender. <br> If chopping the squash in half proves troublesome for you (it is a <br>seriously <br>hard squash), you can also roast the squash whole and then cut it in half once it is tender. This takes about an hour. Check out the instructions for this at the end of the guide below. <br> As I mentioned before, spaghetti squash has a very mild flavor. It\u2019s not something you\u2019d necessarily serve all on its own, but it\u2019s fantastic when paired with sauces and other richly seasoned main dishes. I also love it layered in casseroles. If I\u2019m serving the squash as a side dish, I usually toss the noodles with a little butter or olive oil to keep them from sticking, and season them with a little salt. Below are a few more of our favorite recipes here at Kitchn. <br> Do you love spaghetti squash? What do you like to do with it? <br> <br>Ingredients<br> 1 medium spaghetti squash (2 to 3 pounds) <br> <br>Equipment<br> Sharp <br>chef\u2019s knife<br> <br>Cutting board<br> Spoon<br> <br>Roasting pan<br> or 9\u00d713-inch baking dish<br> Fork<br> Aluminum foil (optional) <br> <br>Storage: <br>Cooked spaghetti squash can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months. <br> <br>Roasting the squash whole: <br>Instead of cutting the squash in half, you can also roast it whole. Roast until a fork can easily pierce through the outer peel and all the way to the interior of the squash, about 1 hour. Slice in half and carefully remove the seeds and stringy flesh, then scrape the flesh as directed above. <br> <br>Roasting the seeds: <br>Yes, you can roast spaghetti squash seeds just like pumpkin seeds!

        "How To Make Classic Coffee Cake",
        "<br> Sure, coffee cake can be any cake-like substance served with coffee, but for me, there is only one kind of cake that I want sharing space with my cup \u2014 and that is a big square (it must be square) of rich, buttery cake topped with giant, cinnamon-scented crumbles. This one is my go-to favorite for all occasions. <br> This coffee cake is a riff on our <br>yellow butter cake<br>, which (not coincidentally) is also my favorite butter cake. The biggest difference is that I use sour cream instead of plain milk to give the cake a tender crumb and an ever-so-slight tanginess. <br> Once you make it, this might seem like not enough batter for the baking pan, but it rises significantly in the oven to reach proper cake proportions. <br> I\u2019m a big believer in crumble topping. And in this cake in particular, it should not be an afterthought. After all, the crumble is a central, integral part of the whole coffee cake experience, creating a very desirable layer of lofty decadence. I love big crumbs that get crunchy during baking, giving some textural contrast to the softer cake beneath. Be careful not to mix this topping too thoroughly, or you\u2019ll lose those big pebble-sized crumbles. <br> Bake this coffee cake in a 9\u00d713-inch baking dish and you\u2019ll have a nice number of servings for a crowd (or for my own coffee breaks over the course of a week, ahem). The larger pan also provides increased surface area for crumbs, and therefore, the best cake-to-crumble ratio. <br> This cake keeps well for several days, staying moist and tender right up until the last crumb is consumed. Serve it, of course, with a cup of very strong coffee. ",

        "How To Roast Eggplant",
        "<br> Despite the rumors that eggplant is bitter, fussy, or boring, it can play the role of many other kitchen staples. You can transform eggplant into a <br>luscious dip<br>, make it mimic potatoes (when cooked as <br>fries<br>), or grill it as a \u201c<br>burger<br>.\u201d But roasted eggplant might be this nightshade\u2019s greatest trick \u2014 turning it from soft and spongy to crispy and tender. <br> Most supermarkets carry one type of eggplant, the globe variety, with Thai, Japanese, and even fairytale eggplant regularly available at local markets from July to October. Any of these varieties work well when roasted \u2014 just make sure you\u2019re picking a good eggplant from the start. <br> Look for an eggplant with tight, unblemished skin. Pick it up and give it a gentle squeeze. Eggplant should feel heavy for its size and be free of soft spots. <br> <br>Learn More: <br>The Best Place to Store Eggplant Is Not in the Refrigerator<br> <br> Many of us avoid cooking eggplant because we\u2019ve been beaten over the head with a myth that eggplant must be salted before cooking to remove bitterness. Modern eggplant has been bred to have less bitterness, and salting is not required to that end. Still, some swear that an eggplant must be salted before frying, while others suggest that salting improves texture. Both methods below call for salting and here\u2019s why. <br> Eggplants are natural sponges; they will soak up almost anything they come in contact with \u2014 including salt, oil, and marinades. While testing, I found a quick salting helped season the eggplant cubes and slices, and felt that the salted eggplants soaked up less of the olive oil. Don\u2019t dilly-dally getting either of these eggplant methods into the oven, as they will start soaking up the cooking oil rapidly. That being said, if you\u2019re in rush, feel free to skip the all the salting and rinsing. Simply season the eggplant with just half of the suggested salt amounts. <br> Eggplant is about 90 percent water, which means without tending, this vegetable will steam rather than roast in the oven. To avoid this, be mindful of spacing the eggplant in a single layer with room around each cube or slice to avoid steaming. Flipping the eggplant about halfway through also prevents the crisp roasted layer we desire from going limp in the oven. ",

        "<br> I\u2019m pretty much a fan of any spicy condiment so, yeah, I love Buffalo sauce, in all its tangy, buttery glory. I\u2019m also a vegetarian \u2014 so no Buffalo wings for me. <br> But who cares! Wings are just the gateway into Buffalo sauce; once you\u2019ve joined the fan club, there are plenty of other (and arguably better) ways to enjoy it. These buffalo cauliflower bites are my latest obsession, and I guarantee they\u2019re the best on the internet. Here\u2019s why. <br> A quick <br>Pinterest search<br> will reveal there\u2019s been more than a few iterations on Buffalo cauliflower bites. Many are designed to mimic restaurant-style <br>Buffalo chicken wings<br>, meaning the florets are dredged in beaten egg, dipped in flour or panko, than baked or fried. Not only did I find this messy, but the bites also turned out more gummy than crisp and the cauliflower itself got lost. <br> So I considered my priorities. I wanted these bites to be as easy as possible (ideally just three ingredients, not counting olive oil, salt, and pepper), as healthy as possible (oven-baked rather than fried, and made with olive oil in place of butter), and as crispy as possible (crank up that oven temperature). They should be delicious as a side dish, just as great for feeding friends as an appetizer, and even better stuffed into corn tortillas for taco night. <br> The solution? Coating large florets in olive oil and seasoning with plenty of salt, pepper, and garlic powder (don\u2019t be shy \u2014 cauliflower itself doesn\u2019t have a ton of flavor, so a heavy hand is a must), roasting at 475\u00b0F on the lowest oven rack until beginning to crisp, tossing with the hot sauce so that every piece is coated, and returning to the oven until the sauce is warm and the veg is extra-crisp. I consider these a wild success; they\u2019re easier, healthier, and more delicious than any others I\u2019ve tried. Plus, they satisfy my Buffalo sauce cravings. <br> Although the brand you use is entirely up to you (Frank\u2019s, Texas Pete, Sriracha, Cholula \u2014 the list goes on), Frank\u2019s RedHot has that classic Buffalo wing flavor. It\u2019s what I use in every Buffalo sauce recipe, and it\u2019s never let me down. <br> <br>Want more? <br>10 Cauliflower Bites We Can\u2019t Get Enough Of<br> ",

Here\u2019s the best way to get your fill of squash with your pasta: Turn it into a decadent sauce, rich with cream and kissed with nutmeg. <br> May I introduce you to butternut squash Alfredo? <br> Rich and creamy fettuccine Alfredo is a fan favorite for good reason, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t play with the <br>classic<br> a bit. Here roasted butternut squash is pur\u00e9ed with cream and Parmesan cheese to create a velvety Alfredo sauce that coats every inch of the al dente pasta. <br> The squash, along with the garlic that\u2019s roasted alongside it, lends a nutty, earthy quality to the sauce that gives it the depth that\u2019s often lacking in the classic. It\u2019s finished with a sprinkle of chopped parsley before serving, which adds just a touch of freshness to the bowl of comfort. This is one pasta you\u2019ll most definitely find yourself craving all season long. ",

        "Recipe: Homemade Thin-Crust Pizza",
        "<br> The key to a really good pizza is, of course, the crust. I make pizza at home at least once a week, so you can be sure this recipe comes to you after years of very meticulous kitchen testing! <br> Also, the fact that this dough comes together in just a few minutes and doesn\u2019t need time to rise means that you can have pizza for dinner any night of the week. It really is that fast and easy, which is why we believe this is the very best thin-crust pizza dough for a home cook on a weeknight. <br> This crust has a nice bit of crunch, but it\u2019s pliable enough to fold in half if required. The mild wheat flavor is a nice backdrop to whatever toppings you want to layer on top. <br> Since we\u2019re keeping the crust on the thinner side, this dough doesn\u2019t actually require time to rise. You roll it out after kneading it briefly and let it rest on the counter while you prepare the toppings. When it goes in the oven, the heat gives the bread a quick burst of rising, so it will still have some chew when you bite into it. <br> This said, letting the dough rise a little or even refrigerating it overnight gives the dough even more depth of flavor and a crackling crust. Once you\u2019ve finished kneading, let it rise until doubled, divide it in two, and store the balls of dough in separate containers. When you\u2019re ready to make your pizza, take the dough out of the fridge and let it warm up a bit while you prepare the toppings \u2014 10 minutes or so should do it. <br> I never knew a simple pizza dough could be so versatile, but this one truly is. By cutting a corner and skipping the rise, this oven-baked crust straddles the line between crisp and chewy. Baked on the back of a preheated baking sheet, this thin crust is deceivingly sturdy \u2014 strong enough to hold traditional toppings or a brush of jam and a curl of prosciutto to serve as a fancy flatbread at your next dinner party. If you have an hour or less, this is the pizza to make at the last minute for family and friends. <br> \u2013<br>Patty<br>, March 2018 ",

        "How To Cook Rice on the Stove",
        "<br> A very good pot of rice has the ability to transform a humble dinner of vegetables into a venerable feast. Rice is easy to find, inexpensive, and the perfect blank slate for the base of many classic dishes \u2014 <br>stir-fry<br>, <br>butter chicken<br>, and <br>red beans<br> come to mind. <br> A rice cooker is handy if you cook rice (and other grains) regularly and if you\u2019ve got the space to store it, but you don\u2019t actually need any special equipment or ingredients to cook up a pot of stunningly simple, tender, and fluffy rice. <br> In fact, all you really need is a cup of rice, a pot, and a stovetop. Here are the three best ways to cook long-grain white rice, brown rice, and aromatic rices \u2014 like jasmine and basmati \u2014 on the stovetop. <br> Many rice recipes rely on ratios for rice to water. I can cook pasta blindfolded, make grits with ease, and bake potatoes with the best of them. But cooking a pot of rice on the stovetop remained a mystery until I gave up juggling water-to-rice ratios and tried different techniques instead. A good pot of rice holds a mountain of fluffy, separate grains \u2014 no matter the type of rice. And not all rice varieties are the same, so there is no reason to cook them using the same method. <br> These stovetop methods use different pot sizes and water boiling methods (make sure you have a nice, tight-fitting lid for each). Try not to peek while the rice cooks \u2014 that will change the cook time and water absorption rate. <br> Rice, like dried beans, is an agriculture product, meaning it comes from the field and processor with some dirt, debris, and, in rice\u2019s case, starch in the bag or box. Rinsing the rice is the first line of defense against gummy grains, as it washes away loose, powdery starch that can stick to the grains upon cooking. Always use a fine-mesh strainer to rinse your rice under cool running water \u2014 no matter the cooking method. <br> <br>For long-grain white rice: <br>Standard long-grain white rice is best suited for the simmer-and-steam method. Here the rice simmers in water until completely absorbed. Slide the pot off the heat to steam, and with a quick fluff of your fork the rice is ready. <br> <br>For brown rice: <br>Brown rice has a nutty flavor and delightful chew. It also has a tough reputation, often cooking up gummy or underdone. A <br>fool-proof method<br> is what this rice needs, and cooking brown rice like pasta fits the bill. Bring a big pot of water to a boil and stir in the rice. Fish out a grain or two every so often and take a taste. Once the rice is tender and chewy, drain, return the rice to the pot, and steam. <br> <br>For basmati or jasmine rice: <br>When aromatic rice like basmati or jasmine are on the menu, use the pilaf method. Toast the rice in butter and then pour in boiling water. Cook until the water is gone, then steam off the heat for distinct grains of rice that perfume the kitchen and are full of toasty flavor. ",

        "Recipe: Takeout-Style Chicken Lo Mein",
        "<br> Lo mein is a popular Chinese-American dish for good reason \u2014 it\u2019s got savory noodles, crisp veggies, and your choice of protein all packed into one takeout-friendly dish. But with the help of a sauce that also doubles as a marinade for chicken, you can make and dig into a big pile of noodle stir-fry in less than 30 minutes. That\u2019s quicker than it takes for delivery to arrive! <br> Once you heat up your wok or frying pan, this recipe goes quick \u2014 so like any other stir-fry, make sure all your ingredients are prepped and ready for action. While your noodles are boiling, start cooking the veggies. You\u2019ll do this separately from the chicken so that they end up crisp-tender and don\u2019t steam, but you\u2019ll ultimately use the same pan to cook the chicken and finish the lo mein. <br> This recipe is easily adaptable depending on your mood and what\u2019s available. Go with chicken thighs if you like dark meat, use udon noodles if you can\u2019t find lo mein noodles, and use a different vegetable like asparagus if you can\u2019t track down the snow peas or sugar snap peas. It\u2019s hard to go wrong as long as you stick with the same amounts so that there\u2019s a good balance of meat, veggies, and noodles. ",

        "How To Make Applesauce in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> Truthfully, it\u2019s hard to be sad about the end of summer right now. I mean, when there are things like apple picking just ahead of us \u2014 and along with it, homemade applesauce (a fall essential) \u2014 I can\u2019t be anything but thrilled. <br> If you\u2019re new to making homemade applesauce, know that you only need a few ingredients, and turning them into a sauce is much easier than you might think \u2014 especially when you bring in the slow cooker to do most of the work for you. <br> While there are certain apple varieties that lend themselves to being <br>eaten out of hand<br> or <br>baking<br>, everything is fair game when it comes to applesauce. There\u2019s no right or wrong here. Use a medley of your favorite varieties. I love a mix of Empires and Cortlands, but sometimes I toss in a tart Granny Smith or some small, sweet MacIntosh apples to change things up. <br> Older apples that taste mealy and aren\u2019t so great eaten on their own are actually perfect for applesauce. Since the fruit gets cooked down so much, you\u2019d never know those apples started off mealy. <br> Peel all your apples and cut out the cores before you begin \u2014 the peels, tough cores, and seeds don\u2019t cook down like the flesh does. A vegetable peeler makes the job of peeling the apples go quickly. <br> How you cut the apples has an impact on how they cook down into applesauce. Apples cut into larger chunks will take longer to cook, or not break down as much, whereas smaller pieces of apple will cook down much faster. I prefer about one-inch chunks, or even thin slices (although, I always have a knack for forgetting this the first time I make applesauce each fall). This size makes a fairly smooth applesauce with just a few chunky bits here and there to keep things interesting. <br> <br>Save your peels<br>: <br>Did You Know You Can Turn Apple Peels into a Delicious Snack?<br> <br> The beauty of applesauce is that all you really need are a few pounds of apples, some water, and a touch of lemon juice. There are a lot of recipes that call for sugar, but really, you don\u2019t need it. There\u2019s so much natural sweetness in apples, I guarantee this sauce will be plenty sweet on its own. You can also taste the sauce once it\u2019s cooked and stir in a little sugar, honey, or maple syrup if you\u2019d like it to be sweeter. <br> I also like to add a few cinnamon sticks for extra flavor; if you don\u2019t have cinnamon sticks, go ahead and substitute about a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. You could also throw in other fall baking spices, like star anise, a clove or two (no more than that \u2014 cloves are powerful!), or a few slivers of fresh ginger. <br> Aside from the apples themselves, the most important \u201cingredient\u201d in making slow-cooker applesauce is time. Over the course of four hours, this once-crisp fruit will be cooked down to oblivion. It\u2019s helpful to give it a stir once or twice during cooking, but for the most part, you can set it and forget it. <br> Scoop your sauce into a few containers and stash them in the fridge for the week to come! Whether you\u2019re eating the sauce on its own or spooning it over ice cream, you\u2019ve got yourself a homemade treat that makes the end of summer a little more bearable. ",

        "How To Make a Soft-Boiled Egg",
        "<br> The perfect soft-boiled egg should have firm, custard-like whites and a warm, runny yolk \u2014 this is what my host mother taught me when I lived with her family in France for a summer in high school, and it\u2019s still the standard to which I hold my soft-boiled eggs today. An egg like this is just right for scooping daintily from the shell and eating with buttered toast soldiers, an experience that always feels simultaneously sophisticated and happily childlike to me. <br> Making soft-boiled eggs might feel slightly trickier than <br>hard-boiled eggs<br>, but it\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be mastered in the space of a Saturday morning! Here\u2019s a step-by-step tutorial to teach you exactly what to do. <br> A good soft-boiled egg really comes down to timing. Bring the water up to a boil, then lower it to a rapid simmer. Add the eggs to the pot, and <br>then<br> begin timing. If you\u2019re just cooking one or two eggs, five minutes is perfect for a runny yolk, or cook as long as seven minutes for a more firmly set, but still spoonable, yolk. If you\u2019re cooking three or four eggs, add an extra few seconds to your timing. (More than four eggs, and I would recommend cooking in batches.) <br> Don\u2019t just glance at the clock to time your eggs \u2014 set a timer. Using a timer is the best way to get consistent results. <br> Soft-boiled eggs are their own little breakfast package. Nestle your egg in an egg cup, and then use the edge of a knife to gently tap the egg all the way around the top. If you have an egg-cutter, you can use that, too. Pull off the top and dig in. <br> You can use a spoon to scoop out the insides or dip your toast soldiers right into the yolk. Either way, eat the egg while it\u2019s still warm and runny! <br> If you don\u2019t have an actual egg cup, here\u2019s an idea: Fill a small ramekin with a few tablespoons of rice or other uncooked grain and nestle your soft-boiled egg inside. Works like a charm, and as long as you manage to avoid egg drips, you can reuse the rice again and again. ",

        "<br> The question, \u201cWhat are we having for dinner?\u201d is quite often followed closely by, \u201cWhat are we having <br>with<br> dinner?\u201d Roasted vegetables are one of our favorite answers to the question of the quick weeknight side dish, and my latest pick for roasted goodness is broccoli. This recipe takes just a few minutes to throw into the oven and it emerges toasty around the edges and garlicky and a little spicy, if you like. <br> I have strong feelings about cooked broccoli. Like green beans, it\u2019s a vegetable that\u2019s often left nearly raw, under the assumption that it\u2019s healthier or better-tasting when not overcooked into mush. Now, I\u2019m not a fan of mush, but broccoli (and green beans) are tough, fibrous vegetables, and when cooking them I find it better to really have at them until they are supple and tender. Which is not to say that I don\u2019t appreciate raw broccoli; in slaws I like its snappy crunch. But it should go one way or the other, not sit in the middle, confused. <br> This recipe roasts the broccoli until it\u2019s quite tender in the center, and until the florets develop a bit of char around the edges. This adds so much flavor to the dish, giving the lie to the idea that the only way to make vegetables really irresistible is to add lots of fat. <br> It\u2019s also so easy to throw a head of broccoli in the oven, tossed with a little oil, garlic, and vinegar (red pepper flakes too, if you have a taste for the spicy). While the broccoli roasts you can make a pot of pasta, or a pan of chicken. It\u2019s the side dish that goes with nearly anything, on nearly any evening. ",

        "How To Make Sourdough Bread",
        "<br> For many of us home bakers, making a good loaf of sourdough bread feels like striving for the World Cup or an Olympic gold medal. It\u2019s the challenge to top all challenges and takes real commitment, but it\u2019s also something that\u2019s completely achievable. <br> Are you ready to take on the challenge of a true sourdough bread? If so \u2014 or even if you\u2019re just curious to see what the fuss is about \u2014 here\u2019s everything you need to know! <br> I made my first loaf of sourdough bread roughly 10 years ago with the help of my father (who now owns his own bakery, <br>Brick Oven Bakery<br> in Northfield, Minnesota<br>) and some well-packaged sourdough culture he carried in his suitcase. <br> He coached me through the basic steps; I was skeptical that something made with just flour and water would turn into delicious bread \u2014 but it did, and I was hooked. <br> I\u2019ve been slowly working on my sourdough game ever since. Bread-baking is a passion of mine \u2014 something I do when I need a break from testing <br>chicken tikka masala<br> and <br>impersonating Julia Child<br>. It takes time to coach flour and water into something as beautiful and delicious as a finished boule or batard, and that\u2019s time when I also slow down, breathe a little deeper, and relax into the process. <br> Sourdough bread is something you learn by doing. You\u2019re not going to make a great loaf by reading a recipe or hunkering down with a cookbook; you\u2019re going to have to get your hands in the dough, and you might have to try it a few times. Even after making sourdoughs for years, I still get bloopers, like <br>the first loaf I made<br> from <br>Tartine No. 3<br>. Stay with the process, learn to work with the ingredients, and enjoy the adventure. <br> Sourdough bread is made entirely using wild yeast \u2014 with a strong, active sourdough culture of wild yeast, you won\u2019t need any commercial yeast at all. Wild yeast need a little more coaxing and works a little more slowly than commercial yeast, so sourdough breads are normally mixed, shaped, and baked over the course of a day, or even multiple days. Besides giving the wild yeast time to do its job, this long, slow development time helps tease out more complex, nuanced flavors in the finished bread \u2014 far beyond those of your average loaf of sandwich bread. <br> While the wild yeast is certainly the star of this show, it\u2019s not actually what makes the bread sour. That distinctive sour flavor comes from two kinds of friendly bacteria \u2014 <br>Lactobacillus <br>and <br>acetobacillus \u2014<br> which grow alongside the wild yeast in the sourdough culture and help ferment the sugars in the dough. <br> Also, note that sourdough breads don\u2019t always necessarily taste sour. Depending on how you develop your starter and make your bread, the sour flavor can be quite pronounced or it can be more subtle. The recipe here strikes a balance \u2014 it\u2019s a touch sour, but it\u2019s balanced by a nice range of sweet, earthy, and yeasty flavors. <br> \u2192<br> <br>The Kitchn\u2019s Baking School: Sourdough Breads<br> <br> Before you can make a loaf of sourdough bread, you need to make a sourdough starter. This is a culture of flour and water for growing wild yeast and developing those bacterias. Having a \u201cripe,\u201d or fully developed, starter ensures a good rise and good flavor development in your sourdough bread. <br> You can make your own starter in about five days. On the first day, you mix flour and water into a batter, and let them sit at room temperature overnight. Wild yeast are everywhere \u2014 on the flour, in the air, on your hands \u2014 and they will quickly start to thrive in this culture. Over the next few days, you\u2019ll need to feed the yeast and bacteria by pouring off some of the culture and adding fresh flour and water. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready to use to make bread when the culture becomes very bubbly within just a few hours of feeding, and when it smells sour but fresh. <br> Once you have a starter, you never have to make one again. I keep mine in the fridge, and I feed it roughly once a week. When I want to make a loaf of bread, I take it out a few days ahead and feed it once a day to strengthen it again. <br> <br>\u2192 <br>How To Make a Sourdough Starter<br> <br> I highly recommend weighing all your ingredients when making sourdough bread. Not only is this more accurate, but it\u2019s also ultimately easier. When weighing, all you have to do is dump ingredients in the bowl and watch the scale \u2014 plus there\u2019s no guesswork about <br>did I just add the fourth or the fifth cup of flour?<br> <br> This said, I don\u2019t want this to deter you from trying a loaf of sourdough for yourself. If you\u2019re more comfortable working in cups and tablespoons, those measurements are here for you too. It\u2019s less accurate, but the recipe is forgiving and a few extra or a few fewer grams here or there isn\u2019t going to affect much. <br> We already made the sourdough starter, so now we make the leaven \u2014 this \u201cleaven\u201d is ultimately what gets mixed into the dough. It\u2019s made with a tablespoon of your active starter and a specific amount of flour and water. A tablespoon of starter might not seem like much, but you\u2019ll be surprised at how quickly the yeasts in that tablespoon multiply and make the leaven bubbly! <br> Make the leaven the night before you plan to mix the dough and leave it on the counter. By the next morning, it should be bubbly and smell slightly sour. You can test that it\u2019s ready by dropping a spoonful into a cup of water; if it floats, it\u2019s ready! <br> After you\u2019ve mixed the leaven with the remaining flour and water, let it sit for at least 30 minutes or for up to four hours. During this time, the flour absorbs the water and becomes fully hydrated, which helps gluten formation during the next step. Enzymes in the flour also start to break down the starches into simpler sugars, which become food for the yeast and bacteria in the leaven and also make the bread more flavorful. <br> After this resting step, mix in the salt. Salt is necessary for a flavorful bread, but can inhibit the activity during the autolyse step. <br> After trying a great many different sourdough recipes over the years, I have become a big advocate of the folding method for developing the gluten in the dough, rather than kneading in a stand mixer or by hand. Folding is not only less labor intensive, but it also gives the crumb of the finished bread a better structure and a nicer network of holes (which are a good thing in the artisan bread world!). <br> After the autolyse, begin folding the dough by grabbing some of the dough from the side, stretching it up, and then folding it over on top of the dough. Do this a few times around the bowl, then let the dough rest about 30 minutes before doing it again. After a few rounds of this, the dough will go from shaggy and clumpy to smooth and stretchy. <br> Proofing baskets support the shaped loaves during their final rise before baking. You can buy the same kind of rattan or wicker proofing baskets that bakers use, or you can simply use a colander or a mixing bowl. In either case, line the basket or bowl with a clean dishtowel and coat it generously with flour. Use your fingers to rub the flour into the cloth \u2014 this is what will keep the dough from sticking. <br> Proofing baskets don\u2019t need much maintenance. After you\u2019re done baking, knock out any loose flour, let them dry on the counter, and then store them in a cupboard. If you bake fairly frequently, you don\u2019t need to wash the dishtowel \u2014 in fact, letting the flour build up will help prevent the dough from sticking. Keep an eye out for mold, though, and always let the cloths and the baskets dry thoroughly before storing them again. <br> Dutch ovens are a boon to home bakers. You need a moist, humid environment during the first few minutes of baking to get a good rise from the dough and to develop the crust, but making that happen in home ovens is tricky and imperfect. Dutch ovens solve the problem. Dutch ovens trap the moisture evaporating from the bread and create its own steamy environment. Once the initial baking phase is over, you uncover the pot to release the excess steam and let the bread continue baking. <br> If you don\u2019t have a Dutch oven, you can use any heavy pot with a lid, like a soup pot or even a large saucepan. <br> This whole process, from mixing the initial dough to baking the bread, is a long, slow, drawn-out affair. You can do it in a day if you\u2019re at home and feel like tinkering around in the kitchen for a few hours, or you can spread the process out over a few days. There are a few moments in the recipe where you can pause and put the dough or the shaped loaves in the fridge overnight. This time in the fridge actually helps develop the flavors in the dough even more! <br> This recipe is a modified version of the Tartine bread recipe that Chad Robertson shares in his books <br>Tartine Bread<br> and <br>Tartine No. 3<br>. In my time as a home baker, I\u2019ve gone back to Chad\u2019s master recipe and the variations in these books again and again. It makes a very wet dough, which might feel unfamiliar to you at first, but it\u2019s actually quite easy to work with. The tradeoff to the extra moisture is a really gorgeous crust and a chewy, well-developed crumb. <br> I\u2019ve made a few changes to the original recipe, which I feel make the recipe a little more approachable for us home bakers. Chad\u2019s recipes make two enormous rounds of bread, so I\u2019ve scaled back this recipe to more human-sized loaves. I also modified the amount of leaven created so the full amount is used in the bread (Chad\u2019s original recipe has you discard a portion, which always just seemed wasteful to me). If you\u2019ve made the Tartine bread recipe before, you\u2019ll notice a few other modifications here and there. <br> I also want to encourage you to use this recipe as a jumping-off point. I made it with straight all-purpose or bread flour here, but you can swap in some whole-wheat flour or other whole-grain flour without needing to adjust the recipe. You can also add things like nuts or dried fruit, or experiment with folding in some cooked grains, like quinoa or steel-cut oats. ",

            " Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. This is the autolyse stage where the flour is fully absorbing the water and enzymes in the flour begin breaking down the starches and proteins.",

            " To fold the dough, grab the dough at one side, lift it up, and fold it over on top of itself. Fold the dough four times, moving clockwise from the top of the bowl (or giving the bowl a quarter turn in between folds). Let the dough rest 30 minutes, then repeat. Do this a total of 6 times, every half hour, for a total of 2 1/2 hours. The dough will start out shaggy and very loose, but will gradually smooth out and become tighter as you continue folding.",
            "Let the dough rise undisturbed (30 to 60 minutes).",
            " Once you've finished the folds, cover and let the dough rise undisturbed for 30 to 60 minutes, until it looks slightly puffed. This dough won't double in size the way regular, non-sourdough breads will; it should just look larger than it did when you started.",
            "Divide the dough.",
            " Sprinkle some flour on a work surface and turn the dough out on top. Work gently to avoid deflating the dough. Use a pastry scraper to divide the dough in half.",

            " Sprinkle a little flour over each piece of dough. Use your pastry scraper to shape each one into loose rounds \u2014 this isn't the final shaping, just a preliminary shaping to prep the dough for further shaping. Shape them into rounds by slipping your pastry scraper under the edge of the dough and then scraping it around curve of the dough, like turning left when driving. Do this a few times to build the surface tension in the dough (it makes more sense to do it than to read about it!). Flour your pastry scraper as needed to keep it from sticking to the dough.",
            "Rest the dough (20 to 30 minutes).",
            " Once both pieces of dough are shaped, let them rest for 20 to 30 minutes to relax the gluten again before final shaping.",
            "Prepare 2 bread proofing baskets, colanders, or mixing bowls.",
            " Line 2 bread proofing baskets, colanders, or clean mixing bowls with clean kitchen towels. Dust them heavily with flour, rubbing the flour into the cloth on the bottom and up the sides with your fingers. Use more flour than you think you'll need \u2014 it should form a thin layer over the surface of the towel.",
            "Shape the loaves.",
            " Dust the top of one of the balls of dough with flour. Flip it over with a pastry scraper so that the floured side is against the board and the un-floured, sticky surface is up. Shape the loaf much like you folded the dough earlier: Grab the lip of the dough at the bottom, pull it gently up, then fold it over onto the center of the dough. Repeat with the right and left side of the dough. Repeat with the top of the dough, but once you fold it downward, use your thumb to grab the bottom lip again and gently roll the dough right-side up. If it's not quite a round or doesn't seem taut to you, cup your palms around the dough and rotate it against the counter to shape it up. Repeat with the second ball of dough.",
            "Transfer to the proofing baskets.",
            " Dust the tops and sides of the shaped loaves generously with flour. Place them into the proofing baskets upside down, so the seams from shaping are on top.",
            "Let the dough rise (3 to 4 hours, or overnight in the fridge).",
            " Cover the baskets loosely with plastic wrap, or place them inside clean plastic bags. Let them rise at room temperature until they look billowy and poofy, 3 to 4 hours. Alternatively, place the covered basket in the refrigerator and let them rise slowly overnight, 12 to 15 hours. If rising overnight, bake the loaves straight from the fridge; no need to warm before baking.",
            "Heat the oven to 500\u00b0F.",
            " Place two Dutch ovens or other heavy-bottomed pots with lids in the oven, and heat to 500\u00b0F. (If you don't have two pots, you can bake one loaf after the next.)",
            "Transfer the loaves to the Dutch ovens.",
            " Carefully remove one of the heated Dutch ovens from the oven and remove the lid. Tip the loaf into the pot so the seam-side is down. Repeat with the second loaf. (See Recipe Note if your loaf sticks to the basket.)",
            "Score the top of the loaf.",
            " Use a lame, sharp knife, or serrated knife to quickly score the surface of the loaves. Try to score at a slight angle, so you're cutting almost parallel to the surface of the loaf; this gives the loaves the distinctive \"shelf\" along the score line.",
            "Bake the loaves for 20 minutes.",
            " Cover and bake for 20 minutes.",
            "Reduce the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F and bake another 10 minutes.",
            " Resist the temptation to check the loaves at this point; just reduce the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F. Bake another 10 minutes.",
            "Remove the lids and continue baking 15 to 25 minutes.",
            " Uncover the pots to release any remaining steam. At this point, the loaves should have \"sprung\" up, have a dry surface, and be just beginning to show golden color.",
            "Bake another 15 to 25 minutes.",
            " Continue baking uncovered until the crust is deeply browned; aim for just short of burnt. It might feel a bit unnatural to bake loaves this fully, but this is where a lot of the flavor and texture of the crust comes in.",
            "Cool the loaves completely.",
            " When done, lift the loaves out of the pots using a spatula. Transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. Wait until they have cooled to room temperature before slicing."

We love to marinate it in sweet and savory teriyaki sauce, or serve it with a big dollop of <br>Spanish-style romesco<br>. But our current favorite is definitely wrapping that pork tenderloin in bacon, because as my neighbor says, <br>pork on pork can never be a bad thing<br>. And I must say I agree. <br> This recipe requires a little more work than say, opening the package and <br>tossing the tenderloin in the oven<br>, but I promise it\u2019s worth the few extra steps. Luckily all of the ingredients are pantry staples for me, and I always have pork and bacon in the freezer for when I need an easy meal. <br> Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with using up the things you have on hand, either \u2014 swap maple syrup for brown sugar, Dijon for grainy mustard, or use apricot preserves instead of Major Grey\u2019s. <br> The key to success is securing the bacon with toothpicks (through the sides, parallel to the work surface) and being patient in order to get a good sear. I think a large cast iron skillet is perfect for this task because it goes from stovetop to oven with ease, not to mention bacon is great for <br>seasoning the pan<br>. Brushing the chutney-mustard mixture on top of the pork before finishing it in the oven helps everything get sticky and caramelized, and the leftover sauce can be served on the side at the table. <br> This truly is weeknight dinner at its very best. The first time I made the recipe, my husband let out a few expletives I can\u2019t repeat here. Needless to say, he\u2019s asked for a few encores. I promise after making this, you\u2019ll want to be wrapping bacon around everything, too. And why shouldn\u2019t you? <br> <br>Serve This With: <br>Creamy Spinach Bake<br> ",

        "Recipe: Light & Easy Broccoli Salad",
        "<br> In my Southern family, we grew up eating broccoli slaw that had raisins, peanuts, a sweet mayonnaise dressing, and toasted ramen noodles on top. It\u2019s a delight. But every time I crave it now and look up a recipe, I\u2019m turned off by the amount of mayonnaise or inclusion of the ramen noodle seasonings packet. <br> So I set out to modernize this retro slaw with a few fresh tweaks. The result is easy, lightened-up, and still oh-so-crunchy. <br> Most of the recipes I\u2019ve seen call for a bag of pre-shredded broccoli slaw. Even the recipes that call for fresh broccoli use only the stalks. And while this would be a fine way to use up stalks if you don\u2019t usually <br>eat them<br>, I\u2019m all for using the tops. They shred up a bit fine, but they\u2019re perfectly delicious in this slaw. <br> I will say that a <br>food processor<br> is pretty handy in making this dish. You could finely julienne the stalks and slice the florets into tiny pieces, but it\u2019s much, much quicker with a food processor. <br> I skipped the ramen noodles and used almonds instead of peanuts, which added a little more crunch and a milder flavor. I also used currants instead of raisins, because I love how their smaller size meshes well with the fine texture of the slaw. <br> There is mayonnaise in the dressing, but not nearly as much as in most recipes I saw. It\u2019s just enough dressing to keep everything moist without making a pool at the bottom of the bowl. <br> I\u2019ve eyed this recipe for quite a long time so I was happy to finally give it a go. It\u2019s no doubt a versatile, crowd-pleasing salad that will go with just about anything you\u2019re serving. Grating the broccoli yourself (versus buying bagged pre-shredded) really does make a difference in terms of taste and texture, so do try to go this route if you can. <br> As many previous commenters can attest, this recipe is adaptable. If you can\u2019t find currants, feel free to use one of the many substitutes suggested at the bottom of the recipe \u2014 I personally loved it with dried cranberries and am eager to try it next time with golden raisins. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe based on feedback from you. I toasted the almonds for extra crunch and nuttiness, and lowered the amount of both the sugar and salt in the recipe, as I felt the rice vinegar lent a good amount of sweetness already and the mayo carried a nice balance of flavor as well. <br> \u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, May 2018 ",

There are countless ways to preserve the taste of sweet summer tomatoes, but this compound butter is arguably the easiest.

If you have some thyme, oregano, or rosemary on hand, throw a little to the food processor as well. <br> The result is a vibrant orange butter that can be frozen for up to three months \u2014 although I highly recommended tucking some in your refrigerator to use right now.

The solution, obviously, is to turn to the next best thing: the oven. <br> Doused in a double dose of hot sauce \u2014 first to marinate and then to coat \u2014 these oven-baked wings are arguably just as crispy, just as sticky, and just as irresistible as their deep-fried brethren. Here\u2019s how to make a batch for yourself; you only need four ingredients. (Not including the blue cheese and celery!) <br> Real-deal buffalo wings get deep-fried, then tossed in a mixture of butter and hot sauce. Crispy fried skin and tender chicken plus sticky sauce is pretty much a done deal, as every bar menu can attest. <br> And yes, deep-frying these little wings certainly gives them the crispiest, most succulent coat, but I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s something even better about roasting them in the oven. The hot sauce marinade bakes right into the meat, infusing it completely, and I like how the wings pick up some smoky charred bits here and there. <br> Plus these oven-roasted wings still get tossed in sticky sauce, so they still look the part with none the wiser. Plus you can make huge batches for hungry crowds without having to stand at constant attendance. Plus these wings are arguably a healthier (or at least a less <br>un<br>-healthy) party food. That\u2019s a lot of pluses. <br> Do you know all the parts of a chicken wing? When you eat chicken wings you\u2019re actually eating only 2/3 of the wing, since the whole chicken wing is separated into three pieces: <br> Some grocery stores and butchers sell you wings whole and unseparated \u2014 meaning, the tip, wingette (forearm), and drumette (upper arm) are all connected in one piece. However, many other groceries sell the wings already separated into wingettes and drumettes, and if they don\u2019t, you can always ask your butcher to chop the wing up for you. <br> If you do need to chop up whole wings into the smaller parts, here\u2019s how you do it. First, look for the joints. There will be one connecting the wing tip to the forearm and another connecting the forearm to the upper arm. Wiggle the joints back and forth a few times until you get a feel for where they\u2019re connected, then cut right through the hinge of the joint \u2014 use the heel of your knife (not the tip or front of your knife) and push straight down, <br>hard. <br>I often press the top of the knife with my opposite hand for extra force. <br> For buffalo wings, we\u2019re only interested in the forearm and the upper arm. You can discard the wing tips or save them for the next time you make stock. (You can collect the tips in a freezer bag and keep them frozen for several months.) <br> The hot sauce you use on these wings is really up to you. Pick your sauce: Frank\u2019s, Texas Pete, Sriracha, or Cholula. Anything hot will do; it\u2019s up to you to calibrate the heat to your own taste. <br> For really classic buffalo wing flavor, Frank\u2019s RedHot claims to be the original hot sauce used in original hot wings, and it does indeed have that spicy (but not too spicy) tangy heat we associate with restaurant-style hot wings, so you can\u2019t go wrong there.

        "<br> Perhaps the most time-intensive element of this recipe is waiting for the tofu to dry out. That\u2019s when you do the rest of the prep \u2014 making the sauce and cutting the veggies \u2014 so by the time you pop everything into the oven to cook, the 10 minutes or so it takes goes by in a flash. Would you expect anything less from a recipe from <br>Damn Delicious<br>? <br> The honey in this recipe not only brings balance to the heat of the ginger and red pepper flakes, but also helps the tofu crisp up as it bakes. Be sure to pick up extra-firm tofu; it holds up best during cooking. Green beans are paired with the tofu because they play so nicely with this sauce, but really any vegetable would do \u2014 we\u2019re using radishes the next go-around. ",

        "<br> I know people who actively avoid baked goods with any mention of vegetables, assuming it will turn out tasteless or gummy, with flavor sacrificed in favor of trying to make something healthier. Sure, there are some cakes and quick breads out there that are like that \u2014 but in this case there is no such caveat. In fact, it\u2019s a vegetable that takes this cake to greatness. <br> While tasting pretty much identical to a regular chocolate quick bread, this cake is way more moist \u2014 thanks to the zucchini \u2014 and has a slightly denser crumb. It is a cracking-good way to use some of the many, <br>many<br> zucchini you may have right now, plus it\u2019s kid-friendly (no green flecks!), so everyone will love it! <br> I think a quick bread with two kinds of chocolate <br>and<br> hidden veggies doesn\u2019t require much convincing to make. This loaf cake is easy to mix up, and it\u2019s an ace snack to fulfill those mid-afternoon chocolate cravings. Want to push it more in the dessert direction? A dusting of powdered sugar or some chocolate frosting will set you up with a sweet treat. <br> After reading through your comments, we tested and updated this recipe to help ensure it turns out great for everyone. We reduced the cocoa powder from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup, which keeps the bread plenty chocolate-y while preventing it from becoming dry and crumbly. While some zucchini breads,<br> including our classic recipe<br>, call for squeezing the moisture out of the grated zucchini before baking, this one does not. The extra moisture actually keeps the bread moist. Just make sure to fold the zucchini in gently to avoid overmixing. \u2014 <br>Meghan<br>, August 2018 <br> ",

        "How To Make Better-than-the-Box Rice Krispies Treats",
        "<br> Rice Krispies Treats, when prepared according to the recipe on the box, are pretty close to perfection. For many years I saw no need to change them, but simplicity has its own way of inviting change, so I started tweaking the recipe, adding ingredients and changing some of the techniques to make a Rice Krispies Treat that\u2019s better than any I\u2019ve ever eaten. That\u2019s the recipe I\u2019m sharing here. <br> Because Rice Krispies Treats are so simple, any change feels seismic. All the upgrades in this recipe are small and may even feel fussy (toast the cereal, you say?), but their impact is worth the tiny bit of effort. <br> For each step of making the Rice Krispies Treat, we\u2019re doing one more thing.

        "<br> Hot off the grill, this spicy Korean chicken will not disappoint. Using chicken drumsticks and chicken thigh meat doused in a spicy, flavorful marinade, this grilled chicken needs to make an appearance on your dinner table soon! <br> The summer is in full swing and I\u2019m loving every minute of it. Not sure if it\u2019s the fact that we get to wear shorts and flip-flops, the kids are out of school, there\u2019s an abundance of ice cream and homemade Popsicles in the freezer, or that we can get out and enjoy the sun and nice weather \u2014 whatever it is, summertime is awesome and it\u2019s my favorite season. And for me, summer is synonymous with being outdoors and grilling. <br> I love everything about grilling. Firing up the grill, smelling whatever deliciousness we have going on, and also seeing my husband with his grilling utensils in hand. There\u2019s something about a man who can grill. Too bad he won\u2019t wear the cool apron I got him. <br> And the best thing? When it\u2019s his turn to grill, I get a night off from cooking and can just sit back with a drink in hand and relax. <br> July 4th is right around the corner and the only way my family knows how to celebrate is by inviting friends over and grilling. So kick back, grab a cold one, and fire up that grill. If you like chicken, you\u2019ll love this Spicy Korean Chicken recipe. <br> Wishing everyone a safe and fun July 4th holiday! I hope it\u2019s filled with lots of food and great company. Enjoy! ",

        "How To Make Classic Creamy Chicken Salad",
        "<br> Chicken salad is a favorite treat in my household. Even though it\u2019s a simple recipe with easy-to-find ingredients, there\u2019s still something fancy about it. So while it makes a nice lunch for guests (either in a sandwich or served on a bed of lettuce), I sometimes make up a batch for when it\u2019s just me and I need a pick-me-up. This recipe is an old favorite \u2014 a real classic that can easily be adapted to all manner of delicious variations and additions. Perfect for picnics and potlucks, too! <br> This recipe has been in my family for quite some time. The only real change I\u2019ve made is to substitute plain yogurt for half of the mayo because I like the tanginess and brightness the yogurt brings. The chicken is cubed, which means it has a real presence in the salad as you bite into and chew the larger pieces. You can cut the cubes smaller or even shred the chicken for a more subtle effect. <br> <br>Part of what makes this recipe classic is that calls for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but you can certainly use bone-on, skin-on if you wish. Poach the chicken breasts to keep them moist and tender, and add some aromatics like onions and fresh herbs to give the chicken a little extra flavor. Chicken thighs have also become a popular breast alternative in my household, as they tend to have a little more flavor, and these days I often use them over the breasts. This recipe also works really well if you have leftover chicken from a roast. <br> <br>I prefer using store-bought mayonnaise in my chicken salad, and Hellman\u2019s/Best Foods is the only brand I will let though my kitchen door. But of course you should use the brand you prefer. I have not tried to substitute yogurt for all the mayo (I suspect it will be too tangy and runny), but it\u2019s worth a shot if mayo is on your yuck list. <br> <br>The walnuts are optional, but I really like them for their crunchy texture and slightly bitter taste. Be sure to toast them before adding them to the salad to bring out their nutty flavor and crunch. Other optional additions and variations are listed in the notes, but adding 1/2 of a crisp apple is an especially favorite riff. <br> Be sure to keep the salad chilled, especially when transporting it to a picnic or party. I usually tuck a few freezer packs around the bowl. ",

        "How To Make Perfect Pesto Every Time",
        "<br> It\u2019s always tempting to eat pesto by the spoonful. It\u2019s so very fresh and so very green. And those flavors of basil, pine nut, Parmesan, garlic, and olive oil just play so <br>very<br> nicely together. Spread it on sandwiches, toss it with pasta, or yes, treat yourself a single happy spoonful, but definitely absolutely positively make pesto any chance you get. <br> Pesto is an uncooked sauce of fresh basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, and dry aged cheese held together by olive oil. From the Italian word for pounded, pesto was originally made with a mortar and pestle in its home city of Genoa. It\u2019s frequently made in a blender or food processor in most modern kitchens and is a favorite for everything from pasta to chicken. Modern pestos are made from many different combinations of nuts, other herbs, and hearty greens, as well as with or without the cheese. Once you master the basic ratio of nuts to herbs to oil, you can easily swap out one or more of these for your own custom pesto. <br> Besides how heavenly it tastes, the other thing I love about pesto is that it can be whatever you want it to be. Traditional Italian pesto is, of course, made strictly with basil, pine nuts, Parmesan, garlic, and really good olive oil. It\u2019s a classic sauce, no contest. <br> <br>\u2192 Tip Test: <br>Does Blanching Basil Really Make Pesto Stay Green Longer?<br> <br> But you can switch out the basil for another handy herb or leafy green, replace the (crazy expensive, if delicious) pine nuts with a different favorite nut, or swap the Parmesan for pecorino or asiago. Use more or less of anything to suit your tastes. Heck, you can even make a <br>lower-fat pesto<br> by replacing some of the olive oil with ricotta cheese! <br> <br>Process half of the basil first. <br>The best pesto has a mixture of fine and rough pieces of basil in the finished sauce. Traditional pesto is made in a mortar and pestle to get that texture. By adding the basil in two batches (and carefully pulsing) we can replicate that text with less work. <br> <br>Pulse, don\u2019t blend. <br>Part of pesto\u2019s appeal is its rough texture that clings beautifully to pasta and bread. Over process the sauce and pine nuts will be better and the sauce will be to thin to coat pasta. <br> <br>Stream in the oil. <br>Once the basil, pine nuts, garlic and cheese are evenly distributed stream in olive oil using the steady pulse to create an emulsion that keeps the sauce together. <br> Store pesto in the smallest container possible with the smallest top surface area and thoroughly pack it in to eliminate air pockets. Pour a thin layer of olive oil over the surface or press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the pesto, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Pesto can also be frozen for several months. ",

        "How To Make Tomato Paste",
        "<br> Homemade tomato paste is an entirely different \u2014 and utterly more delicious \u2014 beast than the kind you can buy at the supermarket. It takes about a day to make (happily, much of that work is hands-off), and in the end, you\u2019ll have enough tomato paste to last you through several cooking projects. In my book, homemade is worth the effort every time. <br> Most of us know tomato paste as a pantry staple, bought in either small tin cans or (more expensively) imported tubes for easier dispensing. The grocery versions are rarely anything special \u2014 just containers of dense, smooth tomato concentrate. <br> When you make it yourself, you get to choose the tomatoes you use, and thus the flavor of the finished concentrate. Slow-cooking also gives the paste a hearty, rich flavor unlike the store-bought counterpart. <br> There is one thing you should keep in mind: While any tomato can be used to make paste, the kind of tomato you pick will make a difference in your final yield. The times when I\u2019ve made it with heirloom slicing tomatoes, my finished yield filled just three tiny jars; the times when I\u2019ve used meaty paste tomatoes, I got almost twice that. So bear that in mind before diving in with those precious heirlooms. <br> The recipe below gives directions for boil-water canning this tomato paste, but if you\u2019d like to take the easy way out, portion the finished paste into ice cube trays, freeze, and then bag and label the frozen cubes. Anytime you need just a small amount of tomato paste, pull out a cube. These cubes can be frozen for up to nine months. <br> Homemade tomato paste works beautifully in all the traditional places, like soups, stews, and chili. However, the long oven roasting gives it the kind of intense tomato-y flavor that also makes it delicious scraped on toasted baguette rounds and topped with fresh ricotta cheese or painted into a spinach omelet. <br> The most frequently asked questions about this recipe are as follows: \u201cCan I use lemon juice instead of citric acid?\u201d and \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d First, yes, you can use lemon juice, but it must be the bottled variety, which is pasteurized and has a more consistent acidity than freshly squeezed. The Center for Home Preservation recommends 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice for this amount of tomatoes. <br> Secondly, yes, it\u2019s absolutely worth it purely for how good it tastes. I\u2019ve never eaten canned tomato paste smeared on buttered bread or swirled into yogurt, but that is precisely how I\u2019m enjoying my homemade batch this summer. \u2014<br>Meghan<br>, August 2018 <br> <br> When it comes to tomatoes, perhaps you\u2019ve got the basics covered. You\u2019ve made <br>fresh tomato sauce<br>, or roasted them, or thrown a bag in the freezer for easy peeling and sauce-making later. So what\u2019s next? <br> Marisa McClellan of <br>Food in Jars <br>is guiding us through Tomato Preserving 2.0 \u2014 cooking lessons and good ideas for when you\u2019re ready to move on to the next level of preserving tomatoes.

        "How To Make Socca: A Naturally Gluten-Free Chickpea Flatbread",
        "<br> Socca is a popular street food in Nice, France, and is often enjoyed as an appetizer with a glass of crisp ros\u00e9. In our own kitchens, this classic dish can be a go-to, any-time-of-day recipe. Learn how to make it by heart and it might just be one of those recipes that comes close to changing your life. <br> Socca is a traditional dish from Nice, France, and as with many traditional dishes, there are a dozen different ways you can make it. You\u2019ll most often find socca cooked street-side on fiery grills, where the resulting flatbread is coarsely chopped and served in a cone with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. In the South of France, every home cook has their own technique for cooking the chickpea batter, but the ingredients are almost always the same: chickpea flour, water, and olive oil. <br> <br>Read more:<br> <br>The Lesser-Known French Cr\u00eape You Need to Try<br> <br> Not that many years ago, you might have had to venture to a specialty shop to find chickpea flour, but these days most supermarkets sell this gluten-free flour. Some manufacturers label it garbanzo bean flour, but it can be also found under the names gram or besan flour at international markets. <br> Chickpea flour is full of protein, but no gluten proteins. It needs more time to hydrate than all-purpose flour, which is why most socca batters require a rest before cooking. Expect a nutty, beany taste with a delightfully toasty aroma. <br> <br>Read more about chickpea flour:<br> <br>C Is for Chickpea Flour<br> <br> Socca batter can be cooked on the stovetop like other pancakes or baked in the oven, but you won\u2019t be able to mimic the smoky flavors of a Ni\u00e7ois(e) street vendor\u2019s very hot grill without help from the broiler. I\u2019ve found a hybrid baking-broiling method results in the crispiest socca. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F while the batter rests, and then about five minutes before cooking slide a cast iron pan under the broiler and heat the broiler to high. The pan should get a little smoky while it preheats (Open a window or turn on a fan while you\u2019re working on this step.) Then, slick the pan with more olive oil and add the rested batter. Place the pan under the broiler and cook for just a few minutes. <br> The socca won\u2019t rise, but the exterior will blister and blacken a bit under the broiler. You only need five to eight minutes of total cook time to set the outside of the socca but leave the interior creamy. <br> Out of the oven you can slice the socca into bite-sized snacking pieces or into more substantial wedges for lunch or dinner. Socca is pretty delicious all on its own, but you can serve it warm from the oven with some cheeses and <br>cured olives<br> as an easy appetizer. For a light and easy dinner, <br>serve socca slices with a simple green salad <br>and ice-cold ros\u00e9. <br> Socca could easily stand in as a gluten-free pizza crust or as a replacement for the toast on your morning breakfast plate. I\u2019ve easily passed plain, honey-drenched socca off as dessert for my children. We recently ate it topped with fried eggs and a dusting of Parmesan cheese for a late lunch; the runny egg yolk soaking into the creamy, crispy bits was just the thing to make me stop and marvel at the simple pleasure of life-affirming recipes like this one.

        "<br> When it comes to essentials, like tomato sauce, originality is overrated. Marcella Hazan\u2019s classic tomato sauce is famous and adored, and justly so. Scads of bloggers and food writers have written about it, so I\u2019m just following along. This is one of the best sauces I know, and it only needs <br>four<br> (yes, four) ingredients. <br> The idea behind this tomato sauce is simple: Simmer a can of tomatoes with an onion and five tablespoons of butter. Add a pinch of salt and pull out the onion at the end, and you\u2019re left with a bright, velvety tomato sauce with a rich roundness from the butter. The butter doesn\u2019t saw off the edges of the tomatoes\u2019 tanginess in the way that sugar does; instead it complements the brightness and makes it shine. <br> This tomato sauce is also entirely hands-off; you don\u2019t even mince the onion. It\u2019s a great way to knock a meal together with a few cupboard staples. Serve it over pasta with a flurry of cheese, and enjoy tomato sauce with the flair of restaurant richness. <br> It doesn\u2019t replace my favorite meaty sauces \u2014 it\u2019s extraordinarily simple and minimalist \u2014 but it\u2019s very satisfying, and its ease cannot be beat. This sauce is also spectacular as a topping for ravioli or a filling for lasagna. <br> My only change to the original recipe is the addition of black pepper. Look, I just can\u2019t eat a bowl of pasta without a bit of black pepper, and I think this sauce benefits from just a little flurry of pepper at the end. <br> <br> Have you ever tried this famous sauce? What did you think?<br> <br> <br>Related:<br> <br>Easy Weeknight Recipe: Hearty Tomato Sauce<br> ",

        "How To Make Flaky Pie Crust",
        "<br> I am very worried, friends. Worried that the fear of pie crusts may be keeping a great many of you from making your own pies at home. Is this true? Does this sound like you? Do debates over butter vs. lard or tender vs. flaky make you want to run and hide? Well, take a deep breath and grab your notebook \u2014 today we\u2019re going to go over how to make a pie from start to finish, one step at a time. <br> Okay, here\u2019s your first lesson: Homemade pies do not have to be perfect. Really. This is a hard lesson to learn because we <br>want<br> that perfectly crimped and beautifully burnished pie crust <br>so badly! <br>I completely understand. But when your pie crust rips in half while you\u2019re transferring it to the pan or when you don\u2019t have quite enough dough to make those tall, crimped edges, it\u2019s OK. Remind yourself that at the end of the day, you still have pie, and that\u2019s all that matters. <br> Next lesson: The more you make pies, the better you\u2019ll be. Making pie crust is a lot like riding a bike \u2014 it takes a lot of practice before you can pull it off every time. I was just as astounded as you the first time I pulled a pie out of the oven and saw that it hadn\u2019t shrunk, collapsed, burnt, or otherwise become disfigured. I don\u2019t want to jinx myself by saying that I\u2019m now a pie-making pro, but I really do feel that each pie I\u2019ve made has been better than the last. <br> Pie crusts are made by working fat into flour \u2014 when the fat melts during baking, it leaves behind layers of crispy, flaky crust. Yum. But just what fat you use in your pie is a matter of much debate \u2014 one that really boils down to personal preference. All-butter pie crusts have a lovely, rich flavor, but because butter is brittle when cold and softens quickly, it can be difficult to work with. Lard and shortening are easier to work with and, arguably, make flakier crusts, but can leave your crust tasting a little bland. A good solution is to use a mix of both butter and lard or shortening. The recipe below calls for all butter, but feel free to substitute half the butter for shortening or lard if you prefer. <br> The flakiness of a crust is a result of both the fat that you use and how much you work the fat into the flour before adding the water. Because of its higher melting temperature and its unique structure, lard and shortening make the flakiest crusts. But you can still make a very flaky crust using all-butter (or a mix) by not over-incorporating the butter into the flour \u2014 cut it into the flour just until you see pieces no larger than peas. Conversely, if you like a very tender crust, work the butter or lard into the flour until it resembles bread crumbs. <br> One universal truth when making crusts is that you need to keep everything cool, particularly the butter (or lard\u2026or shortening). Warm butter will be absorbed by the flour instead of coating it, resulting in a tougher, less flaky crust. Once you take the butter out of the fridge, work quickly to make the pie crust. Refrigerate the dough between each step. If you want to make a pie during hot weather, try to make it in the morning or in the evening when the temperature is a little cooler. You can also refrigerate your rolling pin and cutting board. Or just work quickly and refrigerate frequently. <br> Last but not least, there are lots of ways to make your pie extra-pretty. I love brushing the top with a simple glaze of egg yolk thinned with a little water. This makes a burnished, glowing crust. A friend of mine brushes her crusts several times during baking to make them even more golden and shiny. You can also brush the crust with cream or sprinkle it with a handful of large-grain sugar. Sparkly! If you\u2019re ready to level-up your pie, try weaving the top crust into a lattice. It\u2019s not that hard, but looks oh-so-pretty. <br>Here\u2019s how<br>. <br> Knowing how to make your own pie from scratch is one of those skills that we feel that every home cook should have under their belt. You might not make pies very often, but when you do, we want to be sure you feel confident making one! <br> We\u2019ve used this recipe many, many times in the years since Emma first shared it. In that time we\u2019ve come to find that a little more flour \u2014 an extra 1/2 cup \u2014 helps make the dough less crumbly. Another update is that we now recommend adding the butter in two additions. Food processors are much stronger than they were even a decade ago when this mixing style first became popular. Incorporating half of the butter before adding the rest of it with some of the ice water will keep you from over-mixing the dough, should you need to add more liquid. <br> <br>\u2014<br>Meghan<br>, August 2018 <br> <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the home?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowls",
        "<br> This is my absolute favorite kind of slow cooker recipe \u2014 one that takes less than five minutes to pull together and then rewards you with a delicious, healthy dinner at the end of the day. These burrito bowls are full of chili-spiced brown rice, black beans, corn, and yes, tender bites of shredded chicken. Everything gets cooked right in the pot, so all you need to do is dish yourself a bowl and sprinkle with cheese. <br> I usually do this recipe in two stages. First, I get the chicken going with some broth and diced tomatoes, and then I add the rice, beans, and corn midway through cooking. This ensures that everything finishes cooking at the same time and the beans don\u2019t get too mushy. If I\u2019m going to be gone for a while and won\u2019t be home to add the rice, I just leave it out of the slow cooker and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving. It dirties one more pot, but it gives me some flexibility with my schedule. <br> The first few times you make this, pay special attention to the rice. I like using brown rice here because it holds its shape better over longer cooking, but it can be a bit hard to judge exactly when it will be done. I use a basic grocery-store brand of rice and it typically finishes cooking in 3 1/2 hours on low in this recipe; whichever brand or variety you use, I suggest checking it after about 2 1/2 hours to see how quickly it\u2019s cooking and if it needs more liquid. (Speaking of liquid, you\u2019ll get some from the canned tomatoes, so you won\u2019t need to add as much broth as you normally would if you were cooking the rice by itself. Even so, use your best judgement if you think more or less liquid is needed.) <br> I use my small three-quart slow cooker for this recipe. It\u2019s just big enough to fit everything at once and give the rice plenty of room to expand as it cooks. If you have a larger slow cooker, I\u2019d suggest doubling the recipe and freezing half for other meals. <br> One of the best things about this recipe, aside from how easy it is to make, is the way all the flavors and ingredients mingle during cooking. The chicken cooks in a tomato-rich, cumin-spiked broth, which then gets absorbed by the rice later on. Every bite ends up deeply seasoned and fragrant with spices. <br> Eat it in a bowl with slices of avocado and a dollop of sour cream, or roll it up in a burrito for lunch. Either way, it\u2019s a win. This simple slow-cooker meal has more than earned its spot in my regular lineup. ",

Sightings finally reached critical mass, and I had to try them for myself. Needless to say, I\u2019m hooked. <br> These pancakes are <br>gluten-free and dairy-free<br> \u2014 they really are made with just bananas and eggs, no tricks. It seems like you\u2019d just end up with scrambled banana-eggs (yuck), but the final product truly resembles a pancake. Piping hot and golden brown, with crispy edges. <br> These are pancakes in the sense that they\u2019re cooked on a stovetop and are lovely drenched with syrup, but they are definitely <br>not<br> a replacement for your favorite Saturday morning recipe. But don\u2019t be disappointed \u2014 they\u2019re something <br>more<br>. <br> Sara Wells of <br>Our Best Bites<br> describes them as being like \u201cthe middle of a piece of French toast,\u201d and I will second that description. They are very custard-like with a soft, yielding texture and a creamy melt-in-your-mouth quality. I would also describe them as being like thick cr\u00eapes. <br> They also definitely taste like bananas, so if you\u2019re not a fan of that flavor, this recipe won\u2019t be for you. There are also dozens of ways to dress them up if you\u2019re willing to add a few more ingredients. A pinch of baking powder will make them fluffier, and a bit of vanilla or honey helps round out the flavor. <br> While these pancakes are incredibly simple, there is one place where I think things can get tricky \u2014 flipping them on the stovetop to cook the second side. The pancakes are very liquidy and the structure is fairly delicate, so if you do a quick scoop-and-flip like you do with regular pancakes, these tend to crumple up or break apart. <br> First of all, keep your pancakes fairly small. Not only will they cook more quickly, but they\u2019re easier to flip. I use about two tablespoons of batter for each pancake, which makes a 3- to 4-inch pancake. <br> When it comes to flipping, here\u2019s what works for me: Let the pancakes cook on the first side until the underside is fairly golden-brown (lift a corner and peek), and until the edges are starting to look set but the middle is still loose like barely set Jell-O. Gently work a spatula about halfway under the pancake, then lift until the unsupported half of the pancake is just barely lifted off the skillet. Lay the pancake back down on the skillet on its other side. Some of the loose batter will probably spill onto the skillet as you do this; just be sure to lay the pancake on top of the spill. Once the second side is set, the pancakes are much easier to scoop and flip, if additional flipping is needed. <br> Using a very thin spatula helps here, too. This is the one I like: <br> These pancakes are awesome on their own, but they also welcome some company. To these pancakes, try adding chopped nuts, chocolate chips, fresh blueberries, or even a handful of leftover granola. Sprinkle these extras over the pancakes on the griddle as the first side cooks. <br> And of course, when you pile these on your plate, don\u2019t forget the syrup. Or a smear of jam. Or maybe some Nutella. It\u2019s your stack of pancakes \u2014 you can eat them however you want. <br>\u2192 <br>10 Little Upgrades for Your 2-Ingredient Banana Pancakes<br> <br> This piece has been updated \u2014 originally posted April 2015.<br> ",

            " Cook until the other side is also golden-brown, about 1 minute more. You can flip the pancakes a few times if you need to in order to get them evenly browned. (Flipping is much easier once the second side is set!)",

        "How To Roast a Chicken",
        "<br> Learning to roast a chicken has a promise beyond what most recipes deliver. Yes, a chicken will become dinner, leftover lunch, and hopefully soup, but a roast chicken also promises an evening spent in the kitchen with family and friends. Mastering a simple roast chicken also teaches kitchen confidence and patience, which the greatest cooks understand. <br> For a recipe much lauded and loved, roast chicken should be, above all things, simple \u2014 the meat tender and juicy, gently seasoned with salt and scented with herbs. Most of your work will be in preparing the chicken for roasting and then finding a way to while away an hour in the kitchen while it cooks. <br> Kitchn first published instructions for a simple roast chicken years ago, and while the method is great, we\u2019ve found that a few small changes make for an even better chicken. You\u2019ll find those updates in the recipe below. <br> The question we get asked most often is \u201cHow do I know my roast chicken is done?\u201d And while a probe thermometer is the best way to determine doneness \u2014 it should register 165\u00b0F in the thickest part of the thigh before coming out of the oven \u2014 there are a few other ways to check. <br> First, follow the general rule of 15 minutes for every pound of chicken, a four-pound chicken is going to take at least an hour. Second, give the drumsticks a shake; they should wiggle quite easily. Lastly, you can insert a knife into the area between the breast and the thigh, cutting into the meat to check that the juices are clear (it\u2019s best to do this test right out of the oven in case the chicken needs to go back in for more cook time). <br> When you\u2019re ready to carve, you\u2019ll need a nice large cutting board and a chef\u2019s knife. I like to start by removing the breast: Make a shallow cut first right down the center of the two breasts to see the breast bone. Then, slice between the breast meat and that bone to remove each breast. Set these aside. <br> Once the breast is removed, you can easily remove the thighs by flipping the chicken over and pulling up on each. The thigh should pull right up, but occasionally you\u2019ll need to run the knife between the thigh and the backbone. Then, lay the chicken thigh flat and cut between the thigh and the drumstick at the joint. <br> You can remove the wings if you like, but I generally leave them on and use the chicken bones for making stock.

        "<br> Sometimes in the rush of life, there is nothing better than an old standby to help nourish your soul. The very classic salad Ni\u00e7oise does exactly that for me. In the midst of trying out new recipes on a daily basis, this meal is like an old familiar friend \u2014 one I can always count on. May it continue to live on in the kitchen! <br> As a recipe developer, I maintain a fairly abnormal eating schedule. Rarely do I enjoy the \u201cstandard\u201d three square meals plus a snack. A typical day for me might include breakfast for dinner, dessert for lunch, and sometimes even cocktails for breakfast. It only makes sense that after a particularly bizarre week, I tend to crave one of a few constant staples to pull me back in line. The salad Ni\u00e7oise (minus the olives! I hate olives!) is one of those non-recipes that never fails to make me feel at ease. <br> There\u2019s really not much to know about salad Ni\u00e7oise, other than how good it is. The traditional French recipe includes lettuce, tomatoes, green beans, tuna, anchovies, olives, and eggs, but these days you might find bell peppers, radishes, corn, artichokes, and onions. The sky is the limit! Personally I prefer the original. I love how classic and elegant all of the ingredients look when composed on the plate, making even the quickest of weeknight dinners seem like an elegant affair. <br> This recipe is really just a jumping-off point, but I highly recommend two things: Use good-quality tuna packed in olive oil, and make <br>this<br> French vinaigrette. I\u2019ve been dabbling with the ingredients and quantities in this vinaigrette for ages in an attempt to match a hard-to-come-by bottle of dressing from a village in Massachusetts. I think I finally found their secret \u2014 lemon-pepper spice mix \u2014 and it\u2019s just the boost I was looking for! <br> I\u2019m definitely not reinventing the wheel here. Just reminding you guys to not forget about the favorites. What about you? What are your old standbys? ",

        "How To Make Easy Zucchini Bread",
        "<br> Is there a summer quick bread more ubiquitous than zucchini bread? It is our favorite vehicle for the overabundance of zucchini that comes in August. We love zucchini most for its keen ability to play either sweet or savory. Bake up this tender loaf of zucchini bread and you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re getting a sweet treat and a serving of vegetables all in one. <br> This zucchini bread recipe is our tried-and-true method that uses up a full pound of zucchini and will make you two gorgeous loaves \u2014 one for now and one for the freezer. <br> Zucchini bread is a sweet quick bread designed to use up a bunch of fresh zucchini at once, much like banana bread. If you\u2019ve never been introduced before, let me say a few words about zucchini bread. First off, it doesn\u2019t taste like zucchini. Nor can you feel pieces of it in the bread itself. Both the flavor and the texture of the shredded zucchini melt into the bread, creating a subtle sweetness and a soft texture. <br> This recipe makes two smallish \u201ctea-sized\u201d loaves. The smaller slices are perfect for an afternoon snack or late-night nosh. If you\u2019d prefer larger slices, bake all of the batter in one single 8\u00d74-inch loaf pan and extend the baking time by about 10 minutes. You can also bake the batter in a muffin pan \u2014 use liners or spray liberally with non-stick spray. <br> Zucchini bread is best served slightly warm with a slathering of butter, so toast leftover bread slightly before serving. As for storing you\u2019ll want to tightly wrap the leftovers and store them at room temperature for just a few days. Move extra loaves to the freezer for long-term storage. <br> This zucchini-packed quick bread is one of the best reasons to turn on your oven in August. We swapped the ground cinnamon originally called for here with lemon zest for more of a fresh, summery flavor. And we simplified the recipe by eliminating a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. <br> If you\u2019re looking to bake this into muffins, be sure to use muffin liners and bake for 16 to 18 minutes. Makes about 24 muffins. <br> <br>\u2014 Meghan, August 2018 <br> ",

        "How To Quick Pickle Any Vegetable",
        "<br> Cool, briny pickles straight from the fridge are one of the simplest pleasures of summer. Quick pickling is also a brilliant solution for preserving a plethora of vegetables from the market or your garden. Quick pickling doesn\u2019t require canning or a bushel of vegetables. Best of all, you can adapt this simple formula for any fresh vegetables; try a mixture of vinegars and spices for a truly custom pickle pleasure. <br> Quick pickles are also known as refrigerator pickles. They are simply vegetables that are pickled in a vinegar, water, and salt (sometimes sugar, too) solution and stored in the refrigerator. Quick pickles don\u2019t develop the deep flavor that fermented pickles do, but they also only require a few days in the brine before they can be enjoyed. Quick pickles also do not require canning when refrigerated. <br> <br>Get the Basics: <br>Easiest Refrigerator Pickles<br> <br> Pickling is best done with super-fresh vegetables. Save the slightly bruised specimens for soups or other forms of preservation. Almost any vegetable can be pickled, and the shape you choose to pickle in is entirely up to you. For example, carrots can be peeled and sliced into matchsticks or coins. Cherry tomatoes are best preserved whole. Green vegetables, such as green beans or asparagus, can be blanched in boiling water for two to three minutes and then shocked in an ice bath to preserve their color, but this step is purely optional. <br> <br>Achieve Better Texture: <br>5 Ways to Give Your Pickles Better Texture<br> <br> For quick pickles, a basic brine is equal parts vinegar and water, but you can adjust the ratio to your preference. Any basic vinegar is game \u2014 white vinegar, apple cider, white wine, and rice vinegar all work well. You can use these vinegars alone or in combination. Steer clear of aged or concentrated vinegars like balsamic or malt vinegar for pickling. <br> <br>Learn More: <br>5 Essential Vinegars for Your Pantry<br> <br> The secret to a really unique, flavorful pickle is in the spices you add to the brine. Dill pickles are nothing more than cucumbers flavored with garlic, dill seed, and red pepper flakes. Carrots become more exotic when pickled with coriander, ginger, turmeric, and thyme. Other classic combinations include green beans with garlic and fresh dill, cherry tomatoes with black peppercorns and garlic, and squash with onion and garlic. <br> <br>Get a Recipe: <br>How To Make Dill Pickles<br> ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Chicken Enchilada Soup",
        "<br> It may seem crazy to make a hearty soup in August, but the occasional dreary, rainy days that pop up this month are a preview of the cooler autumn days ahead. A warm bowl of chicken enchilada soup, made in the slow cooker, is exactly what I crave on those days. <br> Chicken enchilada was the signature soup at one of my favorite lunch spots growing up; I still devour a bowl every time I return home. It is a thicker, richer cousin of chicken tortilla soup \u2014 like you are eating an actual enchilada with a bowl and a spoon. It is the best of both dishes\u2019 worlds! <br> This soup requires very little prep work for the amount of flavor it yields: I started with my favorite red enchilada sauce as the base; it\u2019s so easy but packs in tons of flavor, way more than your average canned stuff. I tossed the sauce into my slow cooker along with corn, beans, and chicken thighs, then left it overnight to work all of its magical slow cooker powers. By morning I had a luscious soup that needed little more than salt and pepper to give it a boost. (Of course, if you feel like gilding the lily, a splash of heavy cream and a handful of cheddar take this recipe over the top!) <br> But how I really knew this chicken enchilada soup was a keeper? My fianc\u00e9 asked if we could keep a batch in the refrigerator at all times, so he could eat it everyday. In my house, that\u2019s the hands down sign of a real winner. You can bet this dish will be making an appearance from now until deep into winter. <br> This recipe is delicious as written, but will be just as tasty if you need to make a few substitutions to make it work with the ingredients you have on hand. Although we call for <br>Mexican-style chili powder<br>, any chili powder is fine to use here \u2014 and if you want the soup to be spicier, simply slice up an extra jalape\u00f1o for garnish. Instead of tomato sauce, feel free to use a can of diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, or even a jar of salsa. <br> \u2013<br>Grace<br>, August 2018<br> ",

        "How To Cook Fluffy, Tasty Quinoa",
        "<br> Quinoa has come a long way \u2014 all the way from the back shelves of health food stores to national supermarket aisles. Its high protein content, sweet and nutty flavor, and delicate texture have made quinoa a popular substitute for starchier pasta and rice (although once you try it, you\u2019re not likely to think of it as a \u201csubstitute\u201d again!). Quinoa is an easy grain to love. <br> Several of us here at Kitchn like to make a big pot of quinoa on the weekends and eat it throughout the week with curry, grilled vegetables, or braised meat. It\u2019s one of the most delicious, fast-cooking lunch staples we know. Here\u2019s how to cook great quinoa \u2014 not mushy or bitter, but delicate and perfectly fluffy. <br> Cultivated in the Andes for over 5,000 years, quinoa (pronounced KEEN-wah) has been called \u201cthe mother grain\u201d and \u201cthe gold of the Incas.\u201d Technically, it\u2019s not a grain but a seed, although it is used in virtually all the same ways as other whole grains. The popularity of quinoa has grown steadily over the years, as people have discovered its pleasant nutty taste and superfood qualities. As a complete protein source also high in iron, magnesium, and fiber, quinoa is not only one of our healthiest pantry staples, but also one that\u2019s incredibly easy and quick to cook. <br> I\u2019ve read that there are 1,800 (!) varieties of quinoa, but there are three main types found in markets in the U.S.: white, red, and black. White quinoa has the most neutral, easy-to-love flavor \u2014 start with this one if you\u2019ve never tried quinoa before. Red and black quinoa both have their own distinct personalities, and I find them to be a little bolder and earthier in flavor than white quinoa. They\u2019re fun in salads or other dishes where their color really pops! <br> The standard cooking method outlined below will work for any kind of quinoa you find. <br> Quinoa has a natural coating, called <br>saponin<br>, that can make the cooked grain taste bitter or soapy. Luckily, it\u2019s easy to get rid of this coating by rinsing the quinoa just before cooking. Boxed quinoa is often pre-rinsed, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to give the seeds an additional rinse at home. Some cookbooks suggest soaking the quinoa, but in our experience this is unnecessary. <br> Use quinoa just as you would any other grain, like rice or barley! It makes a fantastic side dish for almost any meal \u2014 especially if you cook it with broth instead of water and add a bay leaf to the pot. I like serving it as a bed for stews or baked fish. Quinoa can also be used in casseroles, breakfast porridges, and salads. <br> Take a look at the list of recipes below for some ideas! What are your favorite ways to use quinoa? <br> Many readers found that our original recipe, which called for 1 cup quinoa and 2 cups water, resulted in a gummy product. After testing the original as well as multiple other quinoa-to-water ratios, I discovered that 1 cup quinoa to 1 3/4 cups water is the perfect ratio for perfectly fluffy quinoa. We have updated the recipe to reflect the change. <br> \u2013<br>Grace<br>, August 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Meatballs: The Easiest, Simplest Method",
        "<br> When I get a craving for meatballs, I have a very specific meatball in mind: They\u2019re completely tender all the way through without even a hint of toughness. They\u2019re big enough to require a fork, but modest enough to justify several on the plate. Maybe some onions and fresh herbs mixed in. Nothing fancy. Totally old-school. <br> Yes, this is a recipe for those very meatballs. More than a recipe \u2014 I\u2019m walking you through each step, from mixing the meat (use your hands!) to shaping the meatballs to cooking them to perfection. I know what I\u2019m having for dinner tonight. Do you? <br> I don\u2019t want to make anything too complicated here \u2014 meatballs are comfort food and should therefore be kept simple \u2014 but let me just touch on some basics. <br> You can use any ground meat or mix of ground meat you like. My personal favorite is a blend of ground beef and pork. I\u2019ve also done just ground beef and just pork. Ground lamb, turkey, chicken, veal, or buffalo are all also fair game. <br> Keep in mind that the fattier the meat you use, the more tender your meatballs, and vice versa if you use leaner meats. If you want to make meatballs with turkey, chicken, or lean ground meat (or a mix of these), watch the cooking a little more carefully; because they lack fat, they can overcook and become tough much more quickly. <br> One trick to making sure meatballs are totally tender once they\u2019re cooked is to use a binder. Here, we\u2019re soaking breadcrumbs in a little milk until the bread becomes soggy, then mixing that right into the meat. This binder (aka <br>panade<br>) helps add moisture to the meatballs and also prevents the meat proteins from shrinking and becoming tough. (Eggs also contribute to tenderness, so don\u2019t skip them!) <br> If you don\u2019t have breadcrumbs handy, you can use panko, a slice of torn-up bread, or even crumbled saltine crackers. A little yogurt or buttermilk thinned with water also makes a handy stand-in for the milk. <br> Another trick to tender meatballs is not overworking the meat \u2014 mix the meat with the binder and other ingredients just until they\u2019re combined. I also recommend using your hands for this step; since you can actually feel when things are mixed, you\u2019re less likely to overwork the meat. <br> This said, I understand why the idea of squishing meat with your fingers might be a little disconcerting. If you prefer, you can use a stiff spatula or spoon instead. <br> Last but not least, we should talk about how to cook the meatballs! You have two options: roasting them or simmering them in a sauce. <br> <br>Roasting: <br>Roasting is the best option if you\u2019re planning on serving the meatballs in something other than a sauce or if you\u2019re planning to freeze the meatballs for later. Roasting also gives the meatballs a little more flavor since the outside sears in the heat of the oven. You can roast the meatballs under the broiler for maximum browning and crispy-edged effect, or you can cook them more gently by roasting in a hot oven. Both options are described below. <br> <br> Simmering:<br>If you\u2019re planning on serving the meatballs with a sauce, you can also cook the meatballs right along with the sauce. Not only does this gentle simmering make some of the most tender and most flavorful meatballs you\u2019ve ever had, but the sauce also becomes richer and more savory in the process. ",

        "3-Ingredient Recipe: Magic Summer Sauce",
        "<br> A perfect meal, this time of summer, is one that seems to fly out of the refrigerator and onto your plate, with nothing but a brief stop at the grill (or grill pan). A seared steak, crusted with pepper, or a smoky hunk of eggplant straight from the garden with a salad to keep them company. This is easy living, people. <br> But what if you want just a touch more to your meal? Get fancy \u2014 how about a sauce? I stumbled accidentally onto the easiest and punchiest sauce recently \u2014 a magic blend of three ingredients that spices up everything from the grill \u2014 steak, chicken, burgers, a pile of vegetables. Zero cooking required. Just mix and drizzle. Want to see what\u2019s in my magic sauce? <br> With just three ingredients, this falls firmly in the tongue-in-cheek category of \u201crecipes.\u201d The magic three? Yogurt, Dijon mustard, and Sriracha. The yogurt gives creaminess and a little tang; the mustard adds depth and some bitterness (I prefer a mustard that also has a touch of sweetness); Sriracha for spice, of course. You really could use any hot sauce. <br> I stumbled across this when making a steak for myself and my husband. I whipped together these three things and voil\u00e0 \u2014 it was delicious. Super punchy, a little creamy, cold and spicy. I use this all the time as a last-minute dip or sauce for grilled or fresh vegetables, and to spice up a simple chicken breast. <br> From me to you, magic sauce. Don\u2019t make cooking this summer any harder than it needs to be. <br> With grilled meat and veggies on repeat through the summer months, I constantly find myself craving something that just jazzes them up slightly. Now I have this creamy 3-ingredient sauce in my back pocket. It\u2019s the kind of thing that made me wonder why I hadn\u2019t thought of it myself \u2014 I always have the ingredients in my fridge anyway, I just never considered combining them. While the original recipe called for Sriracha sauce, I love the extra heat and flavor that <br>chili garlic sauce<br> brings, so I added that as an alternative if you happen to have it on hand. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, July 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Chicken Lettuce Wraps",
        "<br> For all the times I have ordered chicken lettuce wraps at Chinese restaurants like P.F. Chang\u2019s, inhaled entire \u201cappetizers\u201d by myself, and sighed with happiness while licking sticky sauce from my fingers, it never once occurred to me to try making this dish at home. Partly, lettuce wraps have always felt like an indulgence that needed restriction to restaurant visits only. Partly, I assumed that the secret to their deliciousness surely lay in a long list of ingredients, fussy technique, or both. <br> You see where I\u2019m heading here, yes? We can <br>definitely<br> make chicken lettuce wraps at home. It\u2019s actually super easy and makes a surprisingly quick and healthy weeknight meal. Pick up what you need on your way home, and you can have these for dinner tonight. <br> I can\u2019t claim to know what P.F. Chang\u2019s or other Chinese restaurants put in their secret sauce, but I feel pretty happy with my own. The key ingredient is hoisin \u2014 a sweet, salty, slightly tangy, spiced sauce that\u2019s like the Chinese equivalent to American barbecue sauce. Here, I mix it with some soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil to make a sticky glaze for the chicken in our wraps. <br> This sauce is what gives the chicken filling its rich, savory depth. And (in my professional opinion) what makes these wraps so incredibly addictive, both at restaurants and at home. <br> Of course, a secret sauce requires a delivery vehicle, and in this case, ground chicken does the job. This is one place where the relatively light and mild flavor of chicken is a boon \u2014 any other meat would make this dish too rich. I like the chewy, nubbly texture of ground chicken (or turkey) in this dish, though you could mince some chicken breasts or thighs if you\u2019d prefer. <br> To round out the filling, add some diced mushrooms, water chestnuts, garlic, and ginger. I especially love the water chestnuts \u2014 their wet crunchiness is always a nice surprise in each bite! <br> Bibb or butter lettuce are my picks for these wraps. They have sturdy, broad leaves that hold a good amount of filling without major risk of everything falling apart. Look for relatively small heads with fresh outer leaves that show no signs of wilting. <br> You could also use long leaves of romaine, cut into a few pieces, or even a hearty green, like Swiss chard or collards. <br> Chicken lettuce wraps are a true 30-minute meal, even including the time to chop up the vegetables. As we veer into the warmer months, this is a meal that won\u2019t heat up your kitchen or feel too heavy to eat. It hits that magical middle zone of being both very satisfying and also surprisingly light and refreshing. <br> But wait, there\u2019s more! I\u2019ve found that the chicken filling keeps well in the fridge. This means that I can make a big batch for dinner and then have the leftovers for lunch over the next few days, or make this for a party without cooking at the last minute. Add a splash of chicken broth if the filling looks dry; otherwise, heat up what you need in the microwave. ",

        "How To Make Sloppy Joes in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> All hail the slow cooker! We\u2019ve seen this appliance prove its worth time and time again, but with sloppy joes it makes the easy meal even easier. <br> It takes those messy sandwiches that made our childhoods so delicious, and makes them even tastier. This is all thanks to a hot mix of hearty meat combined with a homemade sauce bursting with deep, rich, tomatoey flavor. <br> While stovetop sloppy joes aren\u2019t particularly tough to make and don\u2019t require a long cook time, sometimes we need an easier way out. Whether it\u2019s work or life or kids, sometimes finding those 30 minutes to get in front of the stove just doesn\u2019t feel feasible. Enter the slow cooker! When I\u2019m faced with those obstacles, the slow cooker feels like my greatest ally. <br> The prep work is simple and limited to chopping the onion and bell pepper, measuring the ingredients for the sauce, and then stirring everything together. From there, the slow cooker does all the heavy lifting. All you need to do is be ready to eat when the timer buzzes. <br> Unlike the sloppy joes of your childhood, there\u2019s no canned sauce or powdered packets here. But just because we\u2019re ditching the packet doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to make this complicated. The ingredients for this sauce can be found in most pantries. As it turns out, everyday ingredients \u2014 like tomato sauce, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce, along with garlic powder and ground mustard \u2014 prove to be quite the combination when the slow cooker is involved. <br> Hours of low, slow cooking give these ingredients ample time to meld together, making for a sauce that\u2019s deeper, richer, and far more flavorful than anything you could ever achieve with 20 minutes on the stovetop. <br> Just as with the classic version, these sloppy joes are made with a base of ground beef. While ground beef with a higher fat content is <br>ideal for burgers<br>, it can make for a greasy sauce. Instead, stick with an 85 percent lean/15 percent fat blend, or another combination that\u2019s even more lean. Since the meat is cooked right along with the sauce, there is no worry about it drying out. <br> There\u2019s also no need to stick with beef only; there\u2019s plenty of space to experiment and get creative. Go ahead and swap the beef for <br>ground turkey<br>, or try a blend of lean ground beef and pork. <br> <br>Sloppy Joes are as nostalgic to me as just about any food, reminding me of easy dinners with dad, complete with folding TV dinner tables and M*A*S*H on the screen. While it doesn\u2019t get simpler than sweet and tangy tomato sauce mixed with ground beef, using the slow cooker certainly makes it more versatile, and results in a more flavorful sandwich. <br> We\u2019ve added a stovetop browning step to the beginning of the recipe. Not only does this guarantee the sandwiches have a chunky, homestyle texture, it also adds a richer and deeper flavor to the sauce. Once browned, stir the beef and the rest of the ingredients together right in the slow cooker and cook on high for just a couple of hours, or leave it on low to simmer for 4 to 8 hours. Expect a darker, sweeter sauce with more caramel-like flavor if you cook the sloppy joes on the longer end of the spectrum. <br> \u2013<br>Patty<br>, June 2018 ",

        "Recipe: Creamy Corn Mac and Cheese",
        "<br> This recipe epitomizes summer comfort food. With two cups of fresh corn kernels, creamy, salty feta (Bulgarian or French, if we\u2019re getting very specific), and the mix of basil and red pepper flakes, this mac and cheese is rich, cozy, and devastatingly easy to make. <br> Basil, corn, and red pepper flakes are three flavors I try to pair together as often as possible during the summer. It\u2019s the push and pull between the heat of red pepper flakes and basil with the sweet, starchy corn that I can\u2019t resist. Heavy cream plus the starch of the corn help thicken the rich sauce, which coats the pasta shells. This mac and cheese is incredible served warm, but sometimes I like it cold when the weather is too hot to bear. ",

Enjoy it as a light dinner, or pack it up for lunch and you might even think twice about ditching it for pizza. <br> This salad proves that you can make that can of chickpeas in the back of your pantry a meal. All that can needs is a little love, which in this case comes from pan-frying the drained beans to make them crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Next, we\u2019re tossing them with some ground cumin for an earthy boost of flavor. <br> Instead of whisking the vinaigrette in a separate bowl and pouring it over the salad, it\u2019s assembled right in the salad bowl itself before the beans and tomatoes are tossed in for fuss-free assembly and easy cleanup.

        "Recipe: Italian Chicken Salad Sandwiches",
        "<br> This is chicken salad for the mayonnaise-hating crowd \u2014 although even if you happen to think mayonnaise is perfectly delightful, this is a nice alternative. It\u2019s got crunch, color, and a tangy Dijon vinaigrette. Plus, it goes really well with some slices of bacon. Just sayin\u2019. <br> I like to roast bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts, and then shred the meat. It\u2019s easy, and the skin keeps the meat moist and flavorful. But if you\u2019ve got some leftover meat from a roast chicken, some grilled chicken thighs, or any other chicken dish, this is a great way to use it up. <br> And, of course, no one says you have to make this into sandwiches. Serve it alone or over some lettuce if you\u2019d like. <br> While I didn\u2019t grow up eating it, sometime during or right after college I fell in love with chicken salad. Chicken salad on whole-wheat bread with lettuce and tomato was a constant staple in my lunchtime routine. But the chicken salad I knew and loved was a version blended with thick mayonnaise, sliced almonds, celery, and raisins. Nothing else was even a consideration. <br> It\u2019s taken a while, but I\u2019m glad I finally expanded my horizons on this front. Elizabeth\u2019s version of Italian chicken salad is light, with fresh, punchy flavors \u2014 from the vinaigrette and fresh parsley \u2014 that make it a lot more exciting. I also love the extra kick of crunch and saltiness from the bacon \u2014 perfect addition. <br> A simple red wine vinaigrette does a stand-up job of tying all the ingredients together into one cohesive salad. There\u2019s not a lot of it, but that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s meant just to lightly wet the ingredients and hold them together. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Kelli<br>, July 2015<br> ",

        "Southern Recipe: Cholula Chicken-Fried Steak with Gravy",
        "<br> Any trip to Texas will likely include an experience with chicken-fried steak and Cholula hot sauce. Chicken-fried steak (lovingly called CFS) is a Southern classic, while Cholula hot sauce (introduced to the states here in Austin, TX) is a popular condiment that adds a Texas kick. See what happens when these icons get hitched in this new take on a Lone Star tradition. <br> Chicken-fried steak is not chicken. It\u2019s just fried like one \u2014 with a flour-based batter that, when done right, yields a delicate flaky, yet fluffy, crust. I prefer a steak that is cooked medium, and that\u2019s no different when it comes to CFS. A thicker sirloin tip roast is the type of cut we need to prevent a well-done steak from arriving at the table. <br> The next key component is the crust. This recipe develops a sturdy, adhesive coating that sticks to the steak with three total coats in flour. Once you have the right steak, and the right batter, the rest is all gravy. <br> <br>Serves 4 to 6<br> <br> 2 pounds sirloin tip roast<br> 1 1/4 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided<br> 3 large eggs<br> 3 tablespoons Cholula hot sauce<br> Kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 2 cups milk, plus more as needed <br> Cut the roast into 4 to 6 steaks, then place the steaks into 2 to 3 gallon-sized resealable plastic bags. Evenly divide 1/4 cup of the flour among the bags, press out as much air as possible, and seal. Shake the bags to coat the steaks with the flour. Using the flat side of a meat mallet or the bottom of a small saucepan, pound the steaks into thin cutlets. This serves to both tenderize the meat and work an even flour coating into the steaks. <br> Place 1 cup of the flour in a wide, shallow bowl. Place the eggs and hot sauce in a second wide, shallow bowl and whisk until beaten and well-combined. <br> Fit a wire rack over a baking sheet. Remove the steaks from the bags and season generously all over with salt and pepper. Working with 1 steak at a time, dredge in the egg mixture, then toss and coat in the flour mixture. Repeat dredging and flouring again, then place on the wire rack. <br> Pour enough oil to cover the bottom of a large, deep skillet about 1/8-inch deep and heat over medium to medium-high heat until 350\u00b0F (the oil should be shimmering and bubble immediately when you drop in a pinch of flour). <br> Add 2 of the steaks and fry to a medium doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks to a clean wire rack or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat frying the remaining steaks, adding more oil to the pan as needed. <br> Remove the pan from the heat and let the oil cool slightly. Carefully pour off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of the oil. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of flour to the pan and whisk as you return the pan to high heat. <br> When the flour-oil mixture begins to bubble, slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly. Whisk until the gravy has thickened to your desired consistency, adding more milk to thin it out if needed. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve the gravy over the steaks. <br> <br>Sirloin tip roast:<br> A sirloin tip roast is a thicker chunk of steak than the typical cubed steak you may normally use for chicken-fried steak. I find this thicker cut to cook more like a steak, to medium doneness, which is my preference. <br> <br>Storage:<br> Leftover steak and gravy can be refrigerated in separate containers for up to 4 days.

        "How To Make the Best Classic Potato Salad",
        "<br> I\u2019ve never met a potato salad that I didn\u2019t like. Use mayo or Greek yogurt, season it with dill or throw in some kalamata olives and sundried tomatoes \u2014 they\u2019re all good. And since no cookout, picnic, or backyard party is complete without a giant bowl of potato salad on the table, there are ample opportunities every summer to try them all. <br> Today, let\u2019s pare it down to the basics and talk about how to make an easy, classic, all-American potato salad. You can serve this one just as it is, or use the recipe as a jumping off point for the potato salad of your dreams. <br> The number one concern when making potato salad is picking and cooking the potatoes. This is <br>potato<br> salad after all! Waxy potatoes are really the best choice here \u2014 they hold their shape after cooking and have a soft, creamy texture. Red-skinned potatoes like Red Bliss are my stand-by for salads, but check out this list of <br>16 Kinds of Potatoes<br> for some other ideas. For a slightly softer \u201cmashed\u201d texture in your salad, you can also try using any all-purpose potato; these have a good balance of waxy and starchy characteristics. <br> When it comes to cooking the potatoes, I take the traditional approach: chop them up and simmer them in water until tender. I usually leave the skins on when I make potato salad \u2014 I like the spots of color they add to the dish, plus they\u2019re thin enough that they\u2019re usually quite tender. If you\u2019d prefer to peel your potatoes, it\u2019s easiest to boil them whole, then peel them and cut them into chunks. <br> <br>\u2192 For step-by-step instructions on this step, see <br>How To Boil Potatoes<br> <br> Classically, mayo and mustard are used to bind together those tender chunks, while celery and shallots add some crunch. Fresh herbs or diced scallions give the salad fresh flavor. Many traditional potato salad recipes also fold in some diced hard-cooked eggs; personally, I like to keep things focused on the potatoes here and save the eggs for egg salad, but the choice is yours. Of course, all these ingredients can be tweaked, riffed, or otherwise toyed with to your heart\u2019s content. This basic recipe and technique are yours to play with. <br> If you\u2019re planning to serve potato salad at an outdoor gathering, keep it out of sunshine and <br>don\u2019t leave it out for longer than 4 hours<br>. Potato salad is notorious for giving hapless picnickers a bout of food poisoning! It\u2019s not actually the mayo that goes bad (mayonnaise is acidic enough to prevent bacteria from growing), but rather the potatoes themselves, which make a perfect medium for bacteria growth. Be safe, everyone! <br> Everyone has their own favorite take on this dish, to be sure. How do you like your potato salad? Do you like the traditional recipe, or do you go further afield for your potato salad fix? ",

Great sangria can be refreshing, and it\u2019s perfect for a summer party. <br> Nowadays with the endless varieties of wine and types of fruit and herb mix-ins to choose from, there\u2019s a signature sangria out there for everyone. No longer are we strictly limited to the <br>classic red wine cocktail<br>; in fact you can even make delicious <br>non-alcoholic sangrias<br>. <br> For this 10-Minute Happy Hour we\u2019re jumping on the bandwagon of Moscato, the slightly sweet and slightly spritzy white wine from the northeastern region of Italy. Moscato is currently beating out Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling for most popular wine in the glass. <br> We\u2019re mixing it up with some peach brandy and ripe white peaches for a pitcher-perfect happy hour. Wrap some melon in prosciutto and you\u2019ve got a gorgeous, not to mention delicious, happy hour. ",

        "<br> There are two schools of thought as to what makes the perfect summer tomato salad. There\u2019s the minimalist approach, <br>as seen in this lovely recipe<br>, letting ripe tomatoes stand on their own with nothing more than a touch of oil and balsamic. This is very good indeed, but there is another approach that is just as good. <br> This is the full-on maximalist tomato salad: tossed gloriously with red pepper, feta, dill, cucumber, and olives. Both are beautiful, both are delicious, but we\u2019re going maximal today. <br> The first time I made this salad, it was at dinner with <br>Emma<br>, and we both agreed that this was one of the best examples of this sort of juicy, crunchy, savory Mediterranean salad we\u2019d ever had. It might have had something to do with the mix of vegetables, or the quantity of savory red onion, or the liberal use of feta cheese. <br> Regardless, this one is a keeper. All the proportions are just right, and the look is so bright and beautiful, you can bet I\u2019ll be taking the maximalist approach at least once or twice this summer. <br> This recipe originally came to us from Michael Symon, who created it as part of a pairing for Pilsner Urquell. (You can see another recipe from his menu here, a remarkably good and easy pasta:<br> <br>Linguini with Heirloom Tomato, Capers, Anchovies and Chilies<br>.) <br> I\u2019ve adapted this tomato salad since first making it, trimming away some of the fussier chef aspects and cutting down on the oil, which was originally a little too generous for my taste. But the credit for this recipe should still go to Symon; it\u2019s a glorious and over-the-top summer tomato salad, with brilliant color and a new mix of flavors in every bite. <br> \u2014 <br>Faith<br>, August 2014<br> ",

        "How To Bake Eggplant Fries",
        "<br> Eggplants are members of the nightshade family of vegetables, which makes them a close cousin of potatoes. Obviously that makes becoming fries a sort of family fairy-tale for eggplant. Surprisingly, eggplant is much easier to turn into fries than the legendary potato. Eggplant takes on a simple breading easily and quickly softens in the oven \u2014 the results are a fry with a crisp outside and creamy, tender interior. <br> There are a few tricks to turning vegetables into fries. The first is making sure that the eggplant is cut into uniform shapes. Cut the eggplant into one-inch rounds first and then slice those rounds into batons \u2014 or thick columns. Leaving the skin on the eggplant helps it hold its shape while coating and cooking. <br> We\u2019ve employed a similar breading on vegetable fries in the past (<br>avocado fries<br> are a favorite), but here we\u2019re using a faster method for getting the breadcrumb coating on the fries. Combining the breadcrumbs and Parmesan in a resealable bag and then using the bag to \u201cshake\u201d the eggplant fries in the coating gets the eggplant covered faster. This is important, as eggplant is notoriously absorbent and will suck up the egg white if left uncoated for long. <br> I\u2019d argue that ranch dressing is a close second to ketchup in the well-loved dip department. Flavoring Greek yogurt with garlic and dried herbs makes a quick and fresh alternative dip for these fries. It keeps incredibly well in the fridge and is equally delicious for spreading on sandwiches as it is for dipping. ",

        "Recipe: Easy French Ratatouille",
        "<br> When your garden is overflowing and your kitchen is packed with produce, there is ratatouille. This thick and silky French stew of eggplant, zucchini, sweet peppers, and ripe summer tomatoes will use up your extra vegetables in one fell swoop, making enough food to feed a crowd, pack for lunch, and <br>still<br> freeze for later. <br> Making ratatouille is definitely a project for a weekend afternoon; it\u2019s easy, but fairly time-consuming. First there\u2019s getting all the vegetables washed, chopped, and ready. Then you need to cook them in batches \u2014 partly so they can brown instead of steam, and partly because the vegetables tend not to fit in a single pot until they\u2019ve started breaking down a little. <br> Once this is all accomplished and the vegetables are simmering away on the back burner, there\u2019s the waiting. You can certainly eat your ratatouille as soon as all the vegetables are warmed through \u2014 that\u2019s a perfectly tasty and fresh meal \u2014 but the real magic of ratatouille happens after it\u2019s been bubbling away for an hour or more. The vegetables melt into each other, turning silky and completely tender, while the thyme and garlic infuse every corner of the pot. Stirring in the basil at the last minute is the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. <br> This recipe for ratatouille comes from my dad, a genuine Frenchman who learned to make the dish while growing up. It\u2019s filling, full of vegetables, and gets even better on the second and third day. I recommend serving it with plenty of crusty bread close at hand. <br> This is the quintessential vegetarian summer recipe \u2014 what else uses and celebrates so much of the bounty of the summer produce? Ratatouille is a great way to turn that bumper crop of summer squash or tomatoes into a tasty side dish or topping for crusty bread. We\u2019ve simplified the recipe a bit and clarified the amounts you\u2019ll need. If you find yourself with even more produce than planned, you can easily double the recipe and freeze the extras for when you want a taste of summer. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Christine<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Sorbet with Any Fruit",
        "<br> When you have a glut of fresh summer fruit, sorbets are the answer. You don\u2019t need a recipe \u2014 just a basic template to follow and a little creativity. Strawberry-peach sorbet? Mint-infused watermelon sorbet? Raspberry-ros\u00e9 sorbet? Yes, let\u2019s make all of these this summer. Let me show you just how easy homemade sorbets can be with this step-by-step recipe. <br> Sorbets are a simple combination of fresh fruit or fruit juice with sugar. That\u2019s it! About two pounds of fruit will be perfect for making a quart of sorbet \u2014 that comes out to about five cups of chopped fruit. A little more or less is fine; this is a basic formula, not an exact science. Puree this fruit and add a little sugar, and that\u2019s your sorbet base. <br> The easiest way to add sugar is to make a simple sugar syrup. Simmer equal parts sugar and water until the sugar is dissolved and let it cool. Most summer fruits are sweet enough on their own that we barely need to add any sugar. Remember, though, that freezing dulls sweet flavors, so we want the base to taste slightly <br>too<br> sweet before we freeze. <br> Sugar plays a larger roll in the sorbet than just sweetening the fruit juice. It\u2019s also crucial for the sorbet\u2019s texture. Too little sugar and the sorbet becomes icy, too much and it can be slushy \u2014 hit the sugar level just right and the sorbet will taste creamy and melt evenly across your tongue. <br> There\u2019s a very simple way to tell if your sugar levels are right: Float a large egg in the sorbet base. Wash and dry a large egg, and then gently lower it into the pureed and strained sorbet base. If you see a nickel-sized round of egg slowing above the surface, you\u2019re golden. If the circle is smaller or if the egg sinks below the surface, you need to add more sugar. If the circle is larger, you need to add a little water or fruit juice. Take a look at the pictures in the gallery below to get a better visual idea for what I mean here. <br> That\u2019s it! Sorbet really is as simple as that. You can celebrate a single fruit in all its glory or use any combination of fruit your little heart desires. Get creative and infuse the simple syrup with herbs and spices, or make it a grown-up sorbet with a little liquor stirred into the base. You can even turn a sorbet into sherbet with a splash of cream or coconut milk. <br> Do you love making sorbet at home? What are your favorite flavors? ",

        "How To Make Dreamy Dairy-Free Vegan Ice Cream",
        "<br> First off, I promise you there are no tricks to this ice cream. This isn\u2019t \u201cice cream\u201d in quotation marks. You\u2019re not going to get your hopes up only to have them dashed with a bowl of icy, flavorless frozen dairy substitutes. This vegan ice cream is the real deal. <br> Yes, it\u2019s creamy. Yes, it tastes like a real dessert that you\u2019d drizzle with caramel sauce and sprinkle with nuts. Yes, it\u2019s dairy-free and vegan too (no eggs!). Here\u2019s what you need to know. <br> I have to give a massive shout-out to our recipe contributor <br>Megan Gordon<br> for putting this type of ice cream on my radar. A few months back, she shared her recipe for <br>Vegan Coconut Almond Chocolate Chip Ice Cream<br>, and she followed it this summer with her <br>Vegan Strawberry Swirl Ice Cream<br>. I started wondering, <br>Is there anything this vegan ice cream base can\u2019t do? <br>It\u2019s high time we shared it with you. <br> The secret is nothing more than coconut milk. Full-fat, creamy coconut milk. Other vegan milk substitutes, like almond milk or soy milk, just don\u2019t cut it when it comes to ice cream. You need the fattiness and unctuousness that can only be found in a can of coconut milk. <br> Along with the coconut milk, we add a little cornstarch. You can also use arrowroot starch, if you prefer. Either way, you combine the starch with the coconut milk and a sweetener, and then cook it on the stovetop until it becomes thick and almost pudding-like. My friend, <br>there is your ice cream base!<br> <br> Let\u2019s back up to that sweetener for a second. I love this ice cream made with agave, especially since the syrupy nature of agave helps prevent ice crystals from forming, keeping the ice cream very smooth. If you\u2019re ok with honey in your diet, you can also use that. Alternatively, you can use maple syrup or a granulated sugar like cane sugar or turbinado. Whatever sweetener works for you! <br> Yes, since this ice cream is almost entirely made of coconut milk, it definitely tastes like coconut. I love it plain, all on its own, but coconut is a great flavor base for just about anything, from the nuts and fruit swirls Megan added to mint or basil, dark chocolate, and tropical flavors. Use this recipe as a base and experiment with your own add-ins! <br> If you\u2019re not a fan of coconut flavor, take a look at Sara Kate\u2019s recipe for <br>3-Ingredient Ice Cream<br>. She uses a smaller proportion of coconut milk, along with a good amount of fruit juice, making more of a fruit-forward creamy sorbet. <br> It is not stretching things too far to call this ice cream life-changing. Whether you\u2019re a vegan or an omnivore, this ice cream is a delicious summertime treat that\u2019s totally worth making. ",

        "How To Turn a $5 Bottle of Wine into a Wine Cooler",
        "<br> Have you found yourself staring blankly into the fridge searching for the perfect beverage? Is it time for a drink, but not time for wine? Does beer sound like a terrible idea? <br> Enter: the wine cooler. A classic combination of wine and bubbles, the wine cooler exists for moments of summer when pure, unbridled refreshment and the glory of wine collide \u2014 so basically, most moments. <br> Wine coolers are more than invigorating pick-me-ups from yesteryear \u2014 they\u2019re masterful costumes for inexpensive wines. By adding a simple splash of soda and a drop of fruity liqueur, these classics are perfect for dressing up an everyday wine, or refreshing a bottle that isn\u2019t as delicious as you\u2019d hoped. <br> There\u2019s a simple formula to make any bottle (or box) a star liquid centerpiece. Chances are, you already have the ingredients. <br> Whether that bottle was a house gift, grocery store steal, or simply an accidental pick at the liquor store, any inexpensive wine will do for a cooler. From Portuguese Vinho Verde to Minnesota Riesling, the formula always delivers. <br> Wines you love on their own (let\u2019s be honest \u2014 we all have a cheap favorite) also make great spritzers, letting you jazz up a regular refresher like a quick Sephora makeover. <br> Generally, I recommend sticking to white and ros\u00e9 wines, since they do best with a chill and their flavors are often delicate and easy to uplift with a dash of this or a splash of that. (White Zinfandel that sells for $7.99 in huge jugs, or Critter Wines definitely fit the bill.) <br> Inexpensive bubbles also pack a one-two punch of alcohol and inherent spritz when it comes to wine coolers. Is that $9.99 Prosecco too sweet? Does the Cava need a flavor boost? Line them up for wine spritzer glory. <br> This is the secret weapon to elevating cheap wine to a truly delicious and aromatic wine cooler. Fruit-flavored or infused liqueurs offer fantastic aromatics, plus a dash of sugar that can make overly tart or astringent wines easier to swallow. These low-proof liqueurs also showcase the best of a wine\u2019s flavors, elevating golden apple tones of Chardonnay or the tropical flavors of inexpensive Sauvignon Blanc. <br> While traditional wine spritzers are made with club soda, coolers can be made with any carbonated beverage, including sweet sodas or tonic. <br> The ideal combination depends on personal taste and the wine available. For a soft, delicate spritzer, you can\u2019t go wrong with original seltzer. For extra oomph, without added sugar or calories, flavored sparkling waters add fantastic aromatics to coolers. Flavors like orange, pomegranate, and raspberry-lime are fantastic counterparts in white wine-based spritzers. <br> For even more flavor, use lemon-lime soda like 7UP or Fresca. Unlike the delicate flavors of a seltzer spritzer, those made with traditional sodas are more conventional store-bought wine coolers \u2014 bursting with fruity flavor and impossible to resist poolside (or couch-side). <br> It\u2019s all about ratios when it comes to making the perfect cooler. A combination of 4 ounces wine, 4 ounces soda, and 2 ounces of liqueur creates a wonderfully refreshing drink that balances the wine with its added ingredients. Use less wine and you run the risk of not tasting it at all, but add more and its flavors and alcohol will dominate. <br> This formula is great because it balances the cooler components and is the perfect size for a pint glass filled halfway with ice. <br> To make the perfect cooler anytime, simply combine the ingredients over ice, and stir to mix the flavors evenly. For a group, batch the wine and liqueur ahead of time and store it in the fridge, adding bubbles and ice just before serving. ",

        "How To Make 3 Easy Coleslaw Dressings",
        "<br> Some things in life are difficult: taxes, air travel over the holidays, mastering the perfect <br>kouign amann<br>. Coleslaw is not one of those things.<br> Classic creamy, crunchy coleslaw<br> is easy. Coleslaw is effortless. Coleslaw asks for nothing beyond a serving bowl and a backyard party that requires its presence. <br> It follows that dressing your homemade coleslaw should also be easy. Here are three different dressings \u2014 mayonnaise, buttermilk, and sour cream \u2014 that are so easy, you can make them in under a minute. <br> It is my firm belief that all coleslaw dressings, no matter what else you may add, require a solid base of mayonnaise. The salad is 99% cabbage, so let\u2019s not quibble over a heathy dose of mayo. Just let it happen. <br> Classic mayo dressing is made entirely with, yes, mayonnaise. It\u2019s rich and delightfully creamy against the cool crunch of the cabbage in a coleslaw. It goes great with a plate of smoked ribs \u2014 or fish tacos, for that matter. These other two dressings, buttermilk and sour cream, opt for half mayo and half dairy. They\u2019re both a bit thinner and a bit less rich, but they bring a great tangy zing to the coleslaw. <br> How does one choose, if one does not already owe allegiance to a particular type of coleslaw? Personally, I\u2019m #TeamButtermilk all the way, and you\u2019re welcome to share my preference. Beyond that, I say that as the summer months stretch onwards, why not give them each a try? If you\u2019re a food-pairing type, I recommend the richer mayo-dressed slaw with leaner foods \u2014 like grilled fish and vegetable kebabs (smoked ribs not withstanding) \u2014 and I like the bright tanginess of buttermilk and sour cream coleslaws with things like cheeseburgers and fried chicken. <br> A gal \u2014 or a bowl of coleslaw \u2014 cannot live on mayo alone. It\u2019s called a \u201cdressing,\u201d after all, so it stands to reason that a few other ingredients are required. A splash of vinegar loosens up the dressing and adds brightness to the salad. A spoonful of sugar might sound like an odd choice here, but it really helps balance everything else \u2014 it\u2019s not so much that the salad is \u201csweet,\u201d but just enough to mellow the edges. Salt is also here, performing its usual <br>salt duty<br> of propping everything else up and making each bite more addictive than the last. <br> Whisk these dressings together in a bowl, or shake them up in a Mason jar for easy transport to your coleslaw\u2019s destination. Throw in any fresh herbs you might have around for some extra panache. These recipes all make enough dressing for one typically sized salad, which in our world means one small head of cabbage and a few carrots. <br> Alrighty! It\u2019s probably taken you longer to read all these words than it will to actually make your dressing. Time to get to it \u2014 your coleslaw awaits. ",

        "<br> Let it be known that the unofficial cocktail of summer 2016 is fros\u00e9 (frozen ros\u00e9 wine). <br>Bon App\u00e9tit<br> came out with a simple recipe in June, and the internet grabbed on with full force. Here\u2019s Kitchn\u2019s own riff on the recipe, with the addition of juicy watermelon and mint. It\u2019s as equally refreshing as it is easy to make. <br> This cocktail requires a little prep the day before, but once everything is ready, it only takes about a minute to make. A couple of notes on preparation and ingredients: The ros\u00e9 loses some of its color when you freeze it, so it\u2019s best to pick something on the darker side. You also want to make sure you freeze your watermelon cubes individually so that the cubes don\u2019t clump together \u2013 this will hurt your blender and it will take longer to blend. I\u2019d also recommend making the mint simple syrup the day before, as the mint flavor gets stronger with time. ",

        "Recipe: Summer Farro Salad with Tomatoes, Cucumbers & Basil",
        "<br> Here\u2019s a delicious and versatile recipe to add to your summer rotation: cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and loads of basil are tossed with hearty and healthful farro to create a perfect pairing for any time of day. <br> I discovered <br>farro<br> by happy accident: I was testing recipes for a print publication and one of them just so happened to be a farro dish. I was unfamiliar with the ancient grain, but fell in love at first bite. Now it is a staple in my house \u2014 it can go from being a<br> rich risotto<br> to an all-purpose salad or side dish in the blink of an eye! <br> This is a really simple recipe that manages to pack in lots of flavor. It pairs equally well with fish, chicken, or pork, but it is also substantial enough to stand on its own. I love the soft crunchiness of the farro as well as its complex, nutty taste. To be honest, cucumber is not normally a favorite ingredient of mine, but it really works in this salad. Don\u2019t skimp on the basil, either; it\u2019s what brings everything together in the end. <br> This salad is quite adaptable to your taste, so don\u2019t be afraid to use up ingredients in your fridge. Crumbled goat cheese or feta would be a nice addition, as would pickled shallots, onions, or corn. Any mix of herbs can work \u2014 think mint, Italian parsley, or even some dill. ",

        "<br> Now that we\u2019re entering the height of sweet corn season, you\u2019re going to want to keep this salad on repeat in your meal plan rotation and make it your go-to dish for picnics, pool parties, and potlucks. Crisp, sweet kernels are charred on the stovetop, then partnered with a slew of ingredients for a salad that\u2019s just the right balance of smoky, spicy, and tangy flavors. Serve it warm, chilled, or at room temperature, it\u2019s up to you, and totally delicious in every form. <br> Consider esquites the off-the-cob version of <br>elote<br>, the popular Mexican street food dish. Elote is grilled sweet corn on the cob that is slathered in a spicy mixture of mayonnaise, crema, and chili powder and then sprinkled with cheese. Esquites takes all the elements of the popular smoky, sweet corn and combines them into a warm, easy-to-eat salad or side for a crowd. <br> Unlike elote and some versions of esquites which start by grilling and charring the whole ear of corn, this version begins by removing the kernels from the cob. It makes prep a little easier and faster since you\u2019re not working with hot corn. Instead of a grill, the corn gets charred on the stovetop in a cast iron pan, and even though there\u2019s no open flame, the kernels still pick up that smokiness that makes this dish so great. When fresh corn is out of season, you can easily swap in thawed frozen corn, though do know that the kernels in the finished salad will be slightly softer than when using fresh. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Kelli<br>, August 2017<br> ",

        "How To Make Classic Creamy Coleslaw",
        "<br> This coleslaw is a classic. As in, <br>the<br> classic, with green cabbage, shredded carrots, and creamy dressing. If you\u2019re looking for a solid, dependable coleslaw that promises to play nice with all the burgers and hotdogs at your next backyard party, then here it is. <br> This diner-style coleslaw is the epitome of what a good slaw should be: green cabbage, a few carrots, and a good dressing. It\u2019s nothing flashy, but that\u2019s as it should be. Slaw is the back-up dancer to flashy barbecue numbers. Its cool creaminess, crunchy texture, and tangy flavor balances out the richness of smoked and grilled meats. <br> This said, I\u2019m not opposed to the occasional riff. Throw in some red or purple cabbage alongside the green \u2014 that mix of colors is <br>so very pretty<br> on the plate. I\u2019ve also been known to toss a few chopped celery stalks or some bell peppers in there. Anything crunchy and fresh will only make the coleslaw better. <br> There are three different coleslaw dressings that show up again and again in the classic American cookbooks: <br> All three are typically cut with some vinegar \u2014 either white wine vinegar or cider vinegar is great \u2014 along with a little sugar and salt. <br> I\u2019m a buttermilk girl, personally, but I respect other coleslaw choices. I also respect the addition of other flavorful things \u2014 a spoonful of mustard, a sprinkle of celery seeds, a bit of grated onion. Sure! Start with one of the three dressings as a base and dress it up however you like. <br> Freshly made coleslaw tends to be at its crunchiest, creamiest best if eaten on the day its made. The longer it sits, either on a picnic table or in the refrigerator overnight, the more liquid is released from the shredded cabbage, which can make the salad overly wet and soggy. <br> If you\u2019re hoping to make the slaw a day or two ahead, I\u2019d suggest prepping the cabbage and carrots, and then storing them, undressed, in a container in the fridge until you need them. The dressing can be made in a mason jar or other small container; when you\u2019re ready to assemble the salad, just shake up the jar and pour. <br> There\u2019s one other option, too: <br>salting the cabbage<br>. This seems counterintuitive since salting the cabbage causes it to wilt, so this requires some trust. Once squeezed of liquid and mixed with the carrots and the dressing, the texture of the cabbage is actually quite crunchy, and the salad itself will keep for several days. <br> Give the coleslaw about an hour to chill in the fridge before you serve it. This gives the flavors time to mingle and relax into each other. For that extra little kiss of coleslaw goodness, save a little bit of the dressing and drizzle it over the slaw just before serving. <br> In the mood for something beyond the usual?

        "How To Grill Watermelon",
        "<br> By this time in August, we\u2019ve all had our fill of cold, refreshing watermelon in every form imaginable, from <br>s\u2019mores<br> to <br>cocktails<br>, but there\u2019s one watermelon dish you haven\u2019t eaten yet. Grilled watermelon sounded strange to me at first too, but the grill caramelizes the melon\u2019s sweetness and gives it a subtle, smoky flavor. Paired with a sweet and spicy seasoning, grilled watermelon can be an intriguing side dish or a surprising dessert. <br> Watermelon for grilling should be cut into triangles with the rind attached, as steaks of watermelon tend to fall apart when flipped and turned with tongs on the grill. A mini watermelon (something under five pounds) provides the perfect amount of watermelon for four to six people. <br> A slightly sweet rub helps give the watermelon beautiful grill marks. Flavor the sugar with salt, some lime zest, and red pepper flakes, and sprinkle this on the watermelon before and after grilling. You can mix up the seasoning however you see fit \u2014 brown sugar, lime, and cumin is another one of my favorite combinations. <br> Grilled watermelon alone is a stand-out side dish. Chop it up and toss it with crumbled feta and mint, serve it with thick Greek yogurt for dipping as a side dish, or go completely sweet for dessert with a scoop of ice cream. ",

        "How To Make Burgers on the Stovetop",
        "<br> If you\u2019re craving a juicy, tender, cheese-topped burger \u2014 one that you can really sink your teeth into \u2014 then you\u2019ve come to the right place, my friend. No dry hockey pucks here! Just the kind of burger you\u2019d normally pay big bucks for at a restaurant. <br> Today we\u2019re talking burgers. From the best kind of ground beef to use to tips for shaping the patties, with a step-by-step recipe for simply the best burgers you\u2019ve ever had \u2014 at home or elsewhere. Ready? <br> After playing around with adding this and that to the ground beef in my quest to make a better burger, I finally realized that it\u2019s really <br>just about the beef<br>. Buy good beef, and you\u2019ll have a great burger. It\u2019s that simple. <br> The ideal ground beef for burgers should be 80% lean and 20% fat, though I can often only find 85% lean and think this still makes great burgers. Just avoid anything leaner than 90% \u2014 those burgers can easily end up dry and crumbly. <br> If you can, buy freshly ground beef from the butcher case. Not only does this tend to be a bit fresher than the packaged meat, but it\u2019s also less compressed, which is important for my next point. (Keep your eye out for deals on good-quality ground beef, too \u2014 you can stock up and freeze the shaped patties for later meals.) <br> Maybe even more than the fat content or the quality of the beef, I\u2019ve found that using a light touch is the real difference between a burger I relish eating and one that becomes tough. The more you handle and mash the beef as you shape the patties, the more compressed and tough the finished burger. <br> Instead, try to handle the beef as little as possible as you form the patties. Break off big fist-sized chunks of the ground beef and press them into rough patties against your work surface with the palm of your hand. Then gently pat the edges into a uniform round shape. Don\u2019t worry if the edges look a little lumpy or have cracks \u2014 resist the temptation to make the patties look neat and tidy. Those cosmetic imperfections are all in the name of a supremely tender burger. <br> Our food editor Christine taught us all this <br>dimpling trick<br>, and I haven\u2019t looked back since. By pressing a shallow \u201cdimple\u201d in the middle of the patty, you avoid the problem of the burgers shrinking to half their size and doming up in the middle. After years of tiny, round burgers, this feels like magic. <br> To make the dimple, just use your fingertips to pat the middle of the patties slightly thinner than the outer edge \u2014 maybe a quarter of an inch more shallow, at most. I always think the finished patties look like tiny frisbees. <br> Cook your burgers in a flat pan over medium-high heat. The patties should sizzle when they hit the pan, and when you flip them, you should see a nicely dark, golden-brown sear on the underside. That\u2019s the sign of a good burger! <br> Also, a wide, very thin spatula works best for flipping \u2014 it lets you quickly slide under the burger and flip it without messing up the nice crust you just formed. It also keeps these looser burgers from falling apart as you flip. (Though if they do fall apart, just press the pieces together and carry on \u2014 top with cheese and no one will ever know.) <br> I find that the spatulas sold for cookies or pancakes work best. A fish spatula would also do a fine job in a pinch. <br> <br>\u2192 My Favorite Spatula: <br> <br> <br> Stovetop burgers are a quick weeknight meal \u2014 very quick. Even if you prefer your burgers well-done, burgers will be ready in 10 minutes <br>tops. <br>Cook any longer and that\u2019s when you wind up with dry, crumbly hockey pucks, no matter how diligently you followed the advice given above.<br> <br> <br> It\u2019s a little nerdy, but I usually set a timer so I don\u2019t accidentally get caught up in conversation or another part of the meal and forget about the burgers. You can also keep an eye on the sides of the burgers \u2014 when you see just a bit of pinkish-red in the very middle, medium-rare burgers are ready; the second that pinkish line disappears, your burgers are medium.<br> <br> <br> Despite all this talk about what makes the \u201cbest\u201d burger, a stovetop burger is really a very quick and simple thing. I just love burgers so much that I tend to get carried away \u2014 don\u2019t let all my jabber intimidate you. Bottom line: Buy ground beef with a bit of fat, use a light touch when forming the patties, and pay attention so they don\u2019t overcook. Do these things and I think you\u2019ll be very happy with your burgers! <br> <br> <br> What are your best tips for stovetop burgers? Any favorite toppings or mix-ins to share? <br> ",

        "<br> It\u2019s the time of year when farmers market stands are bursting with gorgeous berries and their sweet smells fill the air. Don\u2019t resist. Go ahead grab a pint of each! If you can keep yourself from eating them all before you get home, make yourself a pitcher of this sangria \u2014 the first in a series this month of sangrias inspired by the farmers market. <br> Blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries have this sangria screaming <br>summer! <br>Load it up with ice, top with some chilled club soda, and it\u2019s lovely on a hot summer day \u2014 or skip the ice and sip it as is on a cool summer\u2019s evening. Either way, you\u2019ll be glad you did. <br> Traditional red wine sangrias aren\u2019t something I typically crave in summer. However, I found that using a lighter red wine, like a Pinot Noir or a Beaujolais, is a fabulous base for a summer red sangria. Also, since the berries in this sangria are a bit delicate, this drink is best prepared and served right away, without the traditional overnight infusing. <br> This sangria is a great twist on the traditional red wine and citrus combination since three types of berries infuse their flavor into the wine instead. I also really liked the sweetness that the honey and cherry brandy added. The club soda helps to lighten it up, which is great if you\u2019re drinking this on a hot day. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, July 2015<br> ",

        "How To Make Basic Tomato Sauce with Fresh Tomatoes",
        "<br> If you\u2019ve been eyeing those gorgeous tomatoes at the farmers market and wondering what it might take to transform them into jars of delicious red sauce, wonder no more. Here is everything you need to know to make a moderate-sized batch of tomato sauce for your pantry (or freezer!), from picking the right tomatoes to packing the sauce into jars. <br> Fifteen pounds of fresh tomatoes. One afternoon. Eight pints of sauce. It\u2019s go time. <br> Making tomato sauce isn\u2019t very hard, but it\u2019s definitely labor-intensive. Even the relatively small amount that we\u2019re making here \u2014 just enough for a few special mid-winter meals \u2014 will take you a solid afternoon of work from start to finish. If you want to make a larger batch, give yourself even more time for the project and think about recruiting some extra hands to help you out. <br> If you\u2019ve never made tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes before, this is a good place to start. The amount isn\u2019t overwhelming, but you\u2019ll make enough to justify the afternoon. It\u2019s also a small enough amount that you can freeze the whole batch if you don\u2019t feel like canning it. <br> Bottom line: Grab yourself some tomatoes and make yourself some tomato sauce this weekend. You won\u2019t regret it. <br> Any tomato that tastes good to you can be used to make tomato sauce; it\u2019s really that simple. Romas and other paste tomatoes are often recommended for canning because they generally have more flesh with less juice and fewer seeds. However, they are smaller (which means more up-front prep work), and I often find that their flavor isn\u2019t as good as other tomatoes. I used Big Boy tomatoes \u2014 your basic summer slicing tomato \u2014 for the batch I made for this post and couldn\u2019t be happier. If you like what you start with, you\u2019ll like what you finish with. <br> Another factor to consider is the cost of the tomatoes. Anything more than a dollar a pound, and the cost-effectiveness of this home canning project starts to plummet. A friend of mine who tries to can around 180 pounds of tomatoes each summer says she doesn\u2019t pay much attention to the particular tomato variety; she just picks up what she can find for cheap. This often means buying in bulk directly from farms or picking your own \u2014 or, even better, growing your own if you can! <br> Let the sauce cool, then transfer it into freezer containers or freezer bags. Sauce can be kept frozen for at least three months before starting to develop freezer burn or off-flavors. <br> If you\u2019re feeling particularly industrious you can also hot-water can the tomato sauce by moving the hot sauce to sterilized canning jars, sealing tightly with new lids, and boiling for 30 minutes. Want to read more about hot-water canning? <br>Here\u2019s our quick guide<br>. <br> This sauce is the most basic tomato sauce there is \u2014 just tomatoes and some lemon juice to bump up the acidity to safe levels for canning. You can add seasonings like garlic, onions, or herbs, but I like the fact that this is a neutral base for whatever recipe I want to make, from weeknight pizzas to a fancy lasagna. Just avoid using oil if you\u2019re planning to can your sauce, as this can potentially be a <br>source for botulism<br>. <br> Check out this tutorial for making tomato sauce with canned tomatoes: <br>How To Make Marinara Sauce<br> ",

        "How To Make Dill Pickles",
        "<br> Cool and crunchy, delightfully sour and capable of going from snack to sandwich without a hitch \u2014 that\u2019s what I call a good pickle. Did you know they\u2019re a cinch to make at home? You don\u2019t even need to set aside the afternoon; you can make a few pint jars in less than 30 minutes. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to make your own batch of homemade dill pickles right now. <br> Kirby cucumbers are the classic pickling cucumber \u2014 they hold up better than English cucumbers during pickling, remaining firm and crunchy instead of becoming overly soft. I\u2019ve also found that Persian cucumbers make very nice pickles \u2014 they have thinner skin and are the perfect size for packing into pint jars. Persian pickles are what I used in the tutorial today. <br> You can also use this recipe as a template for pickling other vegetables. Okra, green beans, garlic scapes, and even carrots all make delicious pickles if you\u2019re feeling like branching out into other parts of the garden! <br> No matter what cucumber or vegetable you use, make sure they are ripe and feel firm \u2014 avoid limp or wrinkly vegetables. Wash the vegetables before pickling and cut away any bruises or blemishes. <br> The main flavoring for dill pickles comes not from the feathery dill herb fronds we use in so much of our cooking, but rather from the dill seed. It\u2019s not something that most grocery stores carry, but you can find it at Whole Foods, many smaller co-ops with bulk herb counters, and online at places like Penzeys. <br> <br>\u2192 Find It: <br>Dill Seed<br> at Penzeys<br> <br> Aside from dill seed, a few smashed cloves of garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes help round out the flavor of the pickles. You don\u2019t have to stop there, either! Play with mustard seed, celery seed, black peppercorn, or any other spice that tickles your fancy. <br> These pickles are made with a very basic brine of equal parts cider vinegar and water mixed with salt. This brine gets poured over the cucumbers \u2014 whole cukes, spears, or sliced coins \u2014 and transforms the vegetables into pickles. While you can certainly eat the pickles right away, they get even better after they\u2019ve had some time to soak in the brine. <br> Keep the ratios the same, and you can make more or less brine to suit the amount of pickles you want to make. You can also swap out the cider vinegar for rice vinegar, white wine vinegar, or another vinegar to suit your taste. <br> These pickles can be processed in a hot water bath for 5 minutes, which makes them shelf stable for around a year. The downside is that the hot water processing will cook the cucumbers a bit and can sometimes give the pickles a softer texture. If super-crunchy pickles are your aim, skip the processing step and just keep the jars in the fridge \u2014 they\u2019ll keep refrigerated for several weeks. ",

        "How To Make a Fruit Crumble with Any Kind of Fruit",
        "<br> Crumble is a wildly simple fruit recipe topped with a crisp, buttery crumb topping that turns any fruit into a stunning dessert. It\u2019s perfectly suited for summer brunches and backyard BBQs alike. Making crumble is so easy that you barely need a recipe. Once you know the basics of making a crumble topping and how to prepare the fruit filling, you can choose any fruit or combination of fruit from any season. Here are the three essential steps you need to know for making a classic fruit crumble. <br> Crumbles are part of a family of fruit desserts that include crisps and crumbles. Crumble has a streusel-meets-pastry topping that is both crisp and craggle-filled, while the underside is softened by the fruit juices. Crumbles are more fruit-forward than their more elegant pie and tart cousins. I typically add a minimal amount of sugar or spices and let the fruit speak for itself. <br> Here are the three steps you need to know for any kind of fruit crumble. <br> I also don\u2019t usually bother measuring or weighing the fruit I buy for a crumble. When shopping, I imagine my baking dish and then grab as much fruit as I think I\u2019ll need to fill it. As a general rule, 1 1/2 pounds of fruit will fill most baking dishes. Back in my kitchen, I slice the fruit directly into the pan and keep going until it\u2019s filled. If I don\u2019t have enough fruit, I either settle for a fruit-to-crumble ratio that\u2019s closer to 50/50 (not a bad thing) or add a handful of blueberries or another fruit in my bag to round it out. <br> Crumb topping can be as simple as flour and sugar thickened with butter, but two small upgrades make for a tastier crumble topping. First, adding a teaspoon of baking soda to the flour mixture makes the crumble topping more tender. Second, using cold butter and working it into the flour mixture makes for a pastry-like topping reminiscent of pie crust. <br> <br>Pro tip: <br>Crumble topping freezes incredibly well and can be kept on hand for crumble anytime. <br> <br> Read more here: <br>An Ingenious Trick for Easy Fruit Crumble All Summer Long<br> <br> Fruit crumble\u2019s baking success depends on two things: a hot oven and a bubbling filling. Crumble requires more baking time than you think; the top should be brown and the filling should be bubbling. In order to thicken properly, the cornstarch in the filling must boil, which is why bubbling is a key indicator for doneness. If you\u2019re concerned about bubbling over in the oven, you can lay a piece of foil or a baking sheet on the rack under the baking dish. <br> And don\u2019t worry if you see juices puddling at the bottom of the dish after you start to serve \u2014 this is normal, especially if you couldn\u2019t help diving into the crumble while it was still warm and not quite fully set. A spoonful of these syrupy juices is perfect drizzled over the scoop of ice cream you will inevitably want with your crumble. ",

        "How To Make Great Ribs in the Oven",
        "<br> Who says you need a grill to cook good ribs? The lack of outdoor space for a grill at my apartment led me to pass up a good many recipes for barbecued ribs over the years. <br> Now I\u2019ll be making up for lost time. I do believe I\u2019ve cracked the code to making perfectly tender and mouth-watering barbecued ribs in the oven. <br> This is one of those recipes that you almost have to try in order to believe. Rib meat is fairly tough, and it needs a long time to break down and become tender. The oven is actually an ideal environment for this kind of slow and steady cooking. <br> Lifting the ribs above the baking sheet on a rack also lets the heat circulate on all sides. After a few hours, the meat is nearly falling off the bone and you\u2019ll be licking your fingers in no time. <br> Go ahead and adapt this oven-roasting technique to any recipe for barbecued ribs that you take a fancy to. I love them simply brushed with mustard and sprinkled with a favorite spice rub. When I\u2019m feeling fancy, I\u2019ll make my own barbecue sauce and brush that on in the last half hour of cooking. <br> One thing that you <br>don\u2019t<br> get with this method is the smoky barbecue flavor. Sad, but true. To capture a bit of that delicious flavor, add some extra smoked paprika to your spice rub or mix some liquid smoke into the mustard before brushing it on. <br> Clouded by the smoke of mystery and lore, it is no wonder barbecue ribs seem so intimidating. So while fiddling with a smoker might make for an interesting weekend project, the oven and a few hours time are all you really need to serve ribs for supper. <br> \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, May 2018 <br> <br>This post was originally published July 2012.<br> ",

        "How To Make a Fruit Cobbler by Heart",
        "<br> Folks spend a great deal of time waxing poetically about the virtues of pie, but I\u2019m going to make a strong declaration: Fruit cobbler beats the pants off of fruit pie. For starters, there\u2019s no messing around with cold butter and pie dough in a hot kitchen in the middle of July. Cobbler doesn\u2019t have a bottom crust destined for sogginess, and if the juices of a cobbler run a little thin, it actually makes the dessert better. Cobbler delivers a crisp and tender top crust with jammy fruit filling underneath, it begs for a scoop of ice cream, and can go from craving to warm on the table in about an hour. <br> As much as I have strong opinions about cobbler versus pie, I also have very high standards for what makes a good cobbler topping. Regional variations abound, with some mimicking <br>pie dough<br> and others closer to a dumpling than a pastry, but the very best topping for cobbler is an easy sweet cream biscuit. A cream biscuit topping bakes up with crisp crust that breaks under the pressure of your fork, yielding to a tender, cake-like biscuit that greedily soaks up rich fruit juices. <br> Ready for the best cobbler of your life \u2014 one that you can memorize and bake anywhere, anytime? Here\u2019s how to do it. <br> Cobblers, crisps, and crumbles are often grouped together into a family of recipes I like to call casual fruit desserts. They share a similar philosophy and can also have the exact same fruit filling, but their toppings are distinctly different. Cobbler topping should be a thick, dense pastry \u2014 usually a sweet cream biscuit \u2014 with a lightly sweetened fruit filling below. <br> Here are the four steps that every cobbler requires. <br> Cobbler can be made from any fruit, fresh or frozen, and any combination of fruit. As a general rule you\u2019ll want about 6 cups of chopped fruit, roughly 1 1/2 pounds for most baking dishes. Make sure frozen fruit is thawed completely before baking. You can bake a cobbler with just fruit as the filling, but a little sugar and cornstarch tossed with the fruit before baking will work together to create a lush sauce from the fruit\u2019s juices. This is the thing that turns a good cobbler into a knock-out dessert. <br> A cream biscuit is the easiest and fastest path from craving to cobbler satisfaction. These easy-to-make biscuits bake up crisp on top and light and fluffy underneath \u2014 an ideal contrast to the soft, luscious fruit filling. Cream biscuits are a quick bread made tender with full-fat cream, rather than butter and buttermilk. They only require flour, a little sugar, baking powder, and heavy cream. <br> <br>Read more:<br> <br>How To Make Cream Biscuits<br> <br> Cobbler always takes a bit longer to bake than most people think. It\u2019s important that the fruit filling comes to a full boil in the oven to ensure that the sauce is properly thickened. If you\u2019re fearful of undercooked biscuits, go ahead and take a temperature of the biscuits in the middle of the dish \u2014 like all breads they should reach 200\u00b0F when fully baked. <br> Cobblers always bake up a little looser and more juicy than pie, so spoon that valuable liquid over the biscuit topping or a scoop of ice cream and keep in mind the juices will thicken as the cobbler cools. Serving warm cobbler with ice cream is a given, but it\u2019s just as enjoyable when served cool the next day with a dollop of plain yogurt. It\u2019s just the sort of breakfast that will make you a hero of any lazy summer morning. ",

        "How To Grill the Best Corn on the Cob",
        "<br> It\u2019s summer, which means that not only is your grill hot, but corn is also finally juicy and sweet. The two need to meet. While I\u2019d like to tell you it\u2019s as simple as throwing the cobs on the hot grill and letting the two mingle, there is some work that must be done to get the corn and its husk ready for the grill. <br> Grilling corn seems like a basic enough task, yet most grillers cannot agree on the best method. Here we break down why we don\u2019t soak the husk, and how removing some of the husk helps the corn cook and later peel off. We also share a tiny trick for getting some nice blackening on the kernels if you\u2019re into that smoky, charred flavor. <br> For grilled corn, you want the freshest corn possible. Ideally it\u2019s corn that\u2019s at peak season and picked as close to grilling as possible. The color of the kernels matters little, but you want ears that smell sweet, are firm when pressed, and free of blackened tassels, that\u2019s the ideal. Otherwise, just pick up what works for you. <br> <br> Read more:<br> <br>5 Tips for Proper Grocery Store Corn Etiquette<br> <br> Brining or soaking the ears in water before grilling is thought to season and also plump the corn. There are two problems with those theories, though: In order to take on any salt from the brine, ears would have to soak for several days, at which point you\u2019re losing valuable sweetness as the ears age. Secondly, if you\u2019re buying fresh juicy corn, you cannot make it any juicier. While soaking may benefit older or off-season ears, it has no added value for fresh summer corn. <br> <br>More on brining: <br>An Important Tip for Great Grilled Corn<br> <br> Yes, you can throw the whole corn cob, husks and all, directly on the grill. Some people swear by this technique, but sometimes the husk catches fire and burns the corn\u2019s tips. Instead, mindfully trim the stalk\u2019s tassels and peel back a few layers of the husk, so the grill can get to work faster on the corn. <br> Leaving some of the husk intact prevents the corn from drying out on the grill and effectively steams the corn. It also makes peeling and getting rid of the silk easier. <br> <br>Want some char?<br> Simply pull back a one- or two-inch section of the cob and grill that section of the ears last. <br> Grilling the corn over direct heat gives the corn ideal doneness. Much like throwing whole cobs into a campfire, the direct heat works with the husk to steam the corn to perfection. The husk is going to blacken and burn while the corn cooks, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 this makes removing the husks even easier. <br> <br>Learn why: <br>What\u2019s the Difference Between Direct and Indirect Heat?<br> <br> Finished corn will turn bright yellow and become more opaque than fresh. Some areas will char as the husk and silk burn away. Covered, fresh cobs take about 15 minutes to cook, depending on your particular grill. <br> When finished, you\u2019ll have ears of corn with varying degrees of husk and silk clinging to golden, lightly charred corn and you\u2019ll probably be wondering how the heck to husk it. Remove the ears from the grill and cool for five minutes. Then you should be able to easily pull back the husks and silk. Use a clean kitchen towel to wipe away any unwanted silk or charred husk flakes. <br> Personal I think butter and salt are the only toppings you need, but try to serve the corn immediately for the most satisfying results. <br> <br>Get the tip:<br> <br>How To Shuck Corn Quickly & Cleanly<br> ",

        "How To Make Southern Sweet Tea",
        "<br> Before you Southerners read this and start thinking, \u201cAre you kidding me? Who doesn\u2019t know how to make sweet tea?\u201d \u2014 hear me out. I am Florida-born and Georgia-raised, but when I moved to California, one of the first things I noticed was that no one drinks sweet tea out here! I always keep a pitcher ready in my fridge, and my friends inevitably ask me, \u201cHow do you make this?\u201d <br> Today you\u2019re going to find out how. Whether you\u2019ve never heard of sweet tea or have only tried the bottled version, this is a recipe you\u2019re going to want to make this summer. Southerners, chime in here with your best advice! <br> First, a little history on sweet tea. In 1795, the first tea plantations in the United States arrived in South Carolina. Today, there are still a few left in the state. The first sweet tea recipe has been traced back to the cookbook <br>Housekeeping in Old Virginia<br>, by Marion Cabell Tyree, and was published in 1879. It called for green tea, which was more commonly drunk as iced tea at the time, until World War II when green tea importation was cut off and Americans switched to black tea imported from India. <br> Sweet tea is so ingrained in Southern culture that in 2003, as part of an April Fool\u2019s joke, the Georgia Legislature introduced a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for restaurants not to offer sweet tea. In the movie <br>Steel Magnolias<br>, Dolly Parton proclaimed that sweet tea was \u201cthe house wine of the South.\u201d One of my favorite simple pleasures is to sit on the back porch on a velvety Georgia night, sipping sweet tea, and eating a plate of <br>fried green tomatoes<br> while watching fireflies. <br> Sweet tea is more than just adding a spoonful of sugar to a glass of iced tea. First off, it\u2019s usually made in large batches and kept chilled in the fridge, ready for an afternoon visitor or an easy cool-down on a hot summer day. <br> Most recipes call for a relatively quick steep, anywhere from a few swishes of the tea bags through the hot water to a full five-minute dunk, though some Southerners like a nice long steep to make a stronger sweet tea. Mix the sugar into the hot tea so it dissolves completely \u2014 I like the relatively mild sweetness of a cup of sugar in a gallon of tea, but you could certainly add more (or less) to suit your own personal taste. (We Southerners do have a sweet tooth! Coca-Cola, pecan pie, and sweet tea \u2026 Our love of sugar keeps dentists in business.) <br> Chill your sweet tea thoroughly before drinking it. I find the flavor actually changes and improves the more chilled the tea gets. Pour it over ice, and drink it straight, or add a sprig of mint or drop in a few lemon wedges. For a grown-up, after-work version, add a shot of bourbon or other favorite liquor. <br> The best sweet tea is the one in the pitcher in your fridge. If you\u2019ve never made sweet tea before, start with this recipe and then adjust it to taste. Steep the tea for longer, add more or less sugar, squeeze a few lemons into the pitcher \u2014 you like your sweet tea the way you like it, and that\u2019s just fine. <br> Southerners and Southerners-at-heart, I\u2019d love to hear about your \u201chouse recipe\u201d for sweet tea and what advice you have for making the best version. Please share your stories in the comments! ",

        "<br> A few years ago I shared my favorite magic trick in the kitchen: creamy ice cream made with just one ingredient. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2014 just one ingredient, and no ice cream maker needed! <br> What is this one magic ingredient that can be whipped into rich and silky ice cream, with no additional dairy, sweeteners, or ingredients needed whatsoever? <br> If you guessed BANANA, congratulations! You\u2019re right! What? You didn\u2019t know that bananas can make pretty fabulous ice cream, all by themselves? Well, I didn\u2019t either until my sister mentioned that she had been freezing bananas and pur\u00e9eing them into ice cream. <br> \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of thing you discover,\u201d she sighed, \u201cwhen all your friends are vegan, gluten-free, dairy-allergic, and you\u2019re on a no-added-sugar diet.\u201d <br> Her discovery, it turned out, was one that has been known for a long time in health food circles (although still magically new to us). It turns out that <br>frozen bananas<br> are good for more than<br> just dipping in chocolate<br>. If you freeze a banana until solid, then whiz it up in a blender or food processor, it gets creamy and a little gooey, just like custard ice cream. <br> I was surprised at this bit of kitchen wizardry; I assumed that a blended banana would be flaky or icy like other frozen fruit. But no \u2014 it makes creamy, rich ice cream, thanks to its high pectin content. <br> My sister has been experimenting with adding in another ingredient or two, like a tablespoon of peanut butter and another of honey, and since we first published this most basic of recipes, I\u2019ve also played around with versions of banana ice cream that include Nutella, cocoa powder, and strawberry. (My favorite, though, has a touch of sweetened condensed milk and cinnamon.) <br> Have you ever tried frozen-banana ice cream? Has it entered your easy dessert repertoire since we first published it a few years ago? It\u2019s an easy way to stay cool and use up overripe bananas at the same time. <br> In case you\u2019re new to this really marvelous treat, here are step-by-step instructions to get you in on the banana ice cream secret. Isn\u2019t it time you gave it a try? ",

        "How To Make Hollandaise Sauce in a Blender",
        "<br> If you love a good hollandaise sauce, whether it\u2019s over eggs Benedict on Saturday morning or a plate of asparagus at Easter dinner, then you\u2019re a friend of mine. Maybe you didn\u2019t even know that this creamy, buttery, slightly tangy sauce that you love so dearly could be made at home in about two minutes using just a blender. Want to impress your friends this weekend? Invite them for brunch and tell them you\u2019re making hollandaise sauce. <br> Hollandaise is one of the classic French mother sauces, along with <br>b\u00e9chamel<br> and <br>a few others<br>. It\u2019s a sauce that could only have been invented by people with a healthy respect for butter and all its wonders \u2014 to make a hollandaise, you whisk warm melted butter into egg yolks to make an improbably thick, creamy, and luxurious sauce. In French cuisine, a vinegar reduction adds some punch and helps keep the emulsified sauce stable, but at home, a squeeze of lemon juice does the job just fine. <br> Steamed asparagus, salmon, and perhaps most famously eggs Benedict are all classic dishes to pair with a hollandaise sauce, but there\u2019s no need to stop there. A hollandaise turns just about any steamed or roasted vegetable into something dreamy, and it\u2019s a mighty-fine sauce to serve over everything from roast chicken to steak. <br> A good hollandaise depends on the technique of slowly emulsifying warm butter into egg yolks and vinegar or lemon juice. This can be accomplished with a whisk and some arm power, or you can choose the easier, faster route: a blender. Just combine the yolks and lemon juice in a blender, stream in the melted butter, and a few minutes later, your hollandaise sauce is ready for draping over your item of choice. <br> Using a blender also gives you some insurance when making this notoriously finicky sauce, which can quite easily \u201c<br>break<br>\u201d into a buttery, egg-flecked mess if the emulsion doesn\u2019t happen properly. The blades of a blender are far faster and more powerful than even the strongest arm-wrestler, and they can whip the butter into the yolks better than anything else. With a blender, you can promise hollandaise sauce for Easter brunch with real confidence. <br> How much butter you add depends on how thick or thin you like your sauce. As you whiz in the butter, it will start off very thick, then take on the consistency of mayonnaise, and then gradually thin into a silky, pourable sauce. You can stop the blender and check the consistency as you go. Stop adding butter as soon as you are happy with the sauce. <br> I like to start with two egg yolks when making a hollandaise sauce, which will make enough for about four people. You can double the recipe if you are serving a larger crowd. For this number of yolks, I use between eight and 16 tablespoons of butter (1 to 2 sticks), depending on how I\u2019m planning to use it. Eight tablespoons gives me a nice dip for steamed artichokes, and 12 to 16 tablespoons makes a pourable sauce for fish or eggs Benedict. <br> Hollandaise is meant to be a warm sauce, and it\u2019s best if used as soon as it\u2019s ready. Since making hollandaise in a blender is so fast, I usually wait until everything else for the meal is ready and on the table, then I melt the butter in the microwave and make the sauce. <br> If you need to, you can hold the sauce for about an hour if you keep it warm. The best way to do this is to transfer the sauce to a <br>double-boiler<br> and place over low heat, but you can also try transferring the sauce to another container and keeping it submerged in a bowl of hot water. The more loose and sauce-like your hollandaise, the more it has a tendency to break. You run the same risk if it gets too cool or sits for too long. The solution here is to make a thicker hollandaise. <br> A hollandaise can \u201cbreak,\u201d or separate back into a layer of butter with floating grainy flecks, for a few reasons \u2014 if the butter is added to quickly; if the sauce gets too cold or too hot; or if you\u2019ve waited too long before serving. Making your sauce in a powerful blender makes a more stable sauce that\u2019s less prone to breaking, but even so, it happens. <br> If your sauce does break, all is not lost. Here are a few things to try, in order of desperation: ",

        "How To Bake Chicken Breasts in the Oven",
        "<br> This is the cooking method that made me realize that boneless, skinless chicken breasts can be pretty darn delicious. They don\u2019t have to be dry and boring. They can, in fact, be moist, tender, and full of flavor \u2014 something I actually look forward to having for dinner. <br> I learned this way of cooking chicken in culinary school. It\u2019s technically called \u201cdry-poaching,\u201d but that sounds fussy for what is essentially an incredibly simple technique. Here\u2019s how you, too, can make the best-ever chicken breasts in just a few steps. <br> There is so little fat in a boneless, skinless chicken breast that it\u2019s hard to cook it without the meat ending up dry or just plain tasteless. With this method, we take advantage of the steady, all-surrounding heat of the oven, but just before putting the breasts in to bake, we cover them with a piece of parchment paper. The paper acts almost like the chicken\u2019s missing skin, protecting the chicken and preventing it from drying out. <br> Think of this method as a <br>cross between braising and roasting<br>. The chicken bastes in its own juices and the result is tender, juicy chicken breasts that are succulent and never dry. <br> This way of cooking chicken is incredibly easy and it\u2019s never failed me. I also love it for when I want to cook several chicken breasts all at once, as when I\u2019m cooking for a big family meal or to prep lunches for the week. In the recipe below, I season the chicken with just <br>salt<br> and pepper, but you can use any spices you wish or adapt it to your favorite recipes. <br> Super versatile, super dependable. If you\u2019ve struggled with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, this is definitely the method to try. ",

        "<br> If you are the one who always winds up finishing the last of the salsa when you\u2019re out with friends, then this recipe is for you. It\u2019s not fancy or by any means gourmet, but it goes great with salty chips and cold beer. It\u2019s time to pay your share of the salsa bill \u2014 treat your pals to some restaurant-style salsa tonight. <br> Ripe summer tomatoes make a fresh <br>pico de gallo<br> that is out of this world, but for the rest of the year, you want canned tomatoes. They are the surprising hero of a good restaurant-style salsa. <br> And why not? Cans of tomatoes are much more economical than fresh tomatoes, for both restaurants and home cooks, and during the long months on either side of tomato season, canned tomatoes are arguably better quality and better tasting than the specimens found in the produce section. <br> Even so, I was skeptical when I first made this salsa. Sure, I use canned tomatoes in sauces and soups all the time, but for something like a salsa? But canned tomatoes have an intense, almost concentrated tomato flavor that goes amazingly well with fresh jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Plus, they break down into a saucy consistency that is really what you want in a good party dip with chips. <br> I like using whole canned tomatoes for making this salsa. They break down to that saucy stage more easily in the blender and I tend to like their flavor better, but diced tomatoes also work well. Avoid any tomatoes with added seasonings (read the labels carefully). <br> High-end canned tomatoes will certainly make a tasty salsa, but I feel that it\u2019s not crucial. Spring for the good stuff if you\u2019re throwing a party and have the extra dollars to spend; otherwise, whatever you have in your cupboard will be perfectly fine. <br> Love a chunky salsa? Prefer it pur\u00e9ed to oblivion? No problem. You can make a chunky salsa by pulsing the blender a few times, or leave it running until the salsa is as smooth as you like it. For a thicker texture, you can also drain the tomatoes before blending. <br> This salsa is best if you can let it chill for at least 30 minutes before serving, and it\u2019s even better the next day; this gives the flavors in the salsa time to mingle and mellow. The fresh-made salsa is good, but the salsa you serve a little while later will be even better. ",

        "How To Cook Tender & Juicy Pork Chops in the Oven",
        "<br> What if I told you that I could guarantee perfectly cooked, perfectly tender pork chops, every time? Would you believe me? Or have too many dinners of overcooked shoe-leather pork chops turned you off from this easy addition to the weeknight meal rotation? Let me convince you to try them one more time. Let me convince you to try roasting your pork chops in the oven. <br> Here is our step-by-step recipe for perfectly cooked, perfectly juicy pork chops. <br> I encourage you to look for bone-on pork chops. They take a little longer to cook than boneless chops, but in my experience, they are another way of ensuring tender cooked pork chops. And by \u201ca littler longer to cook,\u201d I\u2019m really only talking about a few minutes. It won\u2019t make a huge difference to your meal prep! <br> After you bring your pork chops home, time to brine! Brining pork chops is one of the best ways way to guarantee a juicy cooked pork chop. Even a <br>quick 30-minute brine<br> (or up to four hours) makes a big difference. <br> It\u2019s not strictly necessary \u2014 you can still use this method to make great pork chops even without brining \u2014 but if you have some extra time, I recommend it. Brining actually changes the cell structure within the meat, resulting in a noticeably juicier chop. The salt brine also seasons the interior of the meat. It won\u2019t taste \u201csalty\u201d \u2014 just well-seasoned. You can even add other seasonings, like garlic, peppercorns, fresh herbs, and lemon, to the brine for more flavor. If you fear bland pork chops, definitely give brining a try. <br> Pork chops are a tender, quick-cooking cut of meat \u2014 so quick-cooking, in fact, that they\u2019re very easy to <br>overcook.<br> This is why I like to start the chops on the stovetop, where they get a good sear, and then transfer them to the oven to finish cooking. The gentle heat of the oven helps us control the rate of cooking a little better and also prevents the outside from getting tough and dry before the middle has finished cooking. <br> You can also make this whole process of cooking pork chops easier by using just one pan. Heat up the skillet in the oven while you get the rest of the meal prepped, then transfer it \u2014 carefully! \u2014 to a stovetop burner to sear the pork chops. Once the chops are golden on the underside, you flip them and transfer the skillet back to the oven. The residual heat from the skillet will sear the other side of the pork chops while the heat of the oven cooks them through. <br> <br> The result is a perfectly cooked pork chop \u2014 one that\u2019s golden and crusted on the outside, and perfectly tender and juicy in the middle. Every time. Serve it with a simple side salad, roasted vegetables, or rice pilaf for an easy and quick weeknight meal. ",

        "<br> Salad bars and the airport quick-grab kiosks have done the spinach and strawberry salad a real disservice, I think. Done well \u2014 done properly \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see why this salad is such a classic. The greens are crisp and tender, and they should be slicked with just enough dressing to be interesting without overwhelming. The strawberries give a juicy burst of sweetness, the cheese adds its luxurious creaminess, and the almonds bring it home with some much-needed crunch. <br> This is the kind of salad that is fancy enough for a Mother\u2019s Day brunch, but also easy to whip together on a weeknight. For either scenario, and all those in between, spinach and strawberry salad will serve you well. <br> There\u2019s really only one thing that can ruin an otherwise good spinach salad: dry, undressed greens. If you pour the dressing over the top of your salad, you end up with gloppy, over-dressed greens sitting above pockets of dry greens that squeak against your teeth. (Shudder.) Woe be to you if you\u2019re the last person to get served. <br> Best to avoid this whole scenario by tossing the greens with the dressing before bringing it to the table. Save a few almonds, goat cheese crumbles, and your prettiest strawberries to scatter over top, and serve the extra dressing on the side in case anyone wants a little extra. <br> I really love this salad with a classic poppy seed dressing, which has a tangy-sweet flavor that brings everything together so nicely. Making it yourself is surprisingly easy \u2014 here\u2019s <br>my favorite recipe<br> \u2014 but certainly feel free to substitute a favorite store-bought brand. <br> My one twist on this salad is to use smoked almonds in place of regular almonds. With so much classic-ness going on with this salad, I like to throw in one unexpected thing to keep it from feeling stodgy! <br> Do you love spinach and strawberry salad? What\u2019s your favorite twist? ",

And no matter the filling, my bagel choice is always the same: an everything bagel. <br> Yes, you can <br>buy the everything bagel spice blend<br> that gives them their signature flavor, but we\u2019ve got something better: a recipe to make it yourself at home. <br> This spice blend includes a combination of toasty, salty, and savory flavors that work together beautifully to make every bite a little different. <br> Everything bagel spice is a mixture of common ingredients you probably have in your pantry right now. It includes poppy seeds, toasted sesame seeds, dried garlic, dried onion, and salt. <br> There\u2019s an even mix of each ingredient, except the salt (there\u2019s slightly less of that). Of course, you can always adjust the ratio to suit your own taste. <br> I think the bigger question is how <br>can\u2019t<br> you use this spice blend! The possibilities are nearly endless. Use it on everything from bagels to <br>avocado toast<br> to bread sticks. Mix it into cream cheese, dip, or <br>hummus<br>. Blend it into <br>scrambled eggs<br> or <br>mac and cheese<br>. <br> When using it on store-bought bagels, first brush the top of the bagel with a very thin layer of water, then sprinkle with everything bagel spice. The water is essential for the spice mix to stick to the bagels. ",

        "How To Cook Mushrooms on the Stovetop",
        "<br> Cooking mushrooms can get kind of tricky. You can eat them raw, so they can be technically be \u201cdone\u201d any time, right? Wrong! When we think about cooking mushrooms on the stovetop, we\u2019re all after the same deep-mahogany perfection we\u2019ve come to expect from a perfectly cooked steak. <br> So whether you\u2019re making a quick meal of <br>mushrooms on toast<br> or you\u2019re saut\u00e9ing enough for a pizza party, here\u2019s how to cook tender, tasty, and totally succulent mushrooms every time. <br> Cooking mushrooms concentrates their flavor and brings out notes of sweet earthiness from the <br>Maillard reaction<br> taking place. The best way to do this is to sear the mushrooms first in a dry pan. The high heat browns the mushrooms while instantly driving off excess moisture. <br> You also want to hear a gentle sizzling the whole time you\u2019re cooking mushrooms. This means that the pan is hot enough to quickly evaporate the moisture and caramelize the mushrooms. If you don\u2019t hear sizzling, adjust the heat until you do. <br> Once cooked, you can add these mushrooms to other dishes (think: stews or braises) or partner them with dinner as their own stunning side. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. ",

        "<br> For a busy cook, caramelized onions pose a conundrum. We love the rich, deeply savory flavor they add to everything from creamy pastas to burgers, but caramelizing onions \u2014 <br>truly caramelizing them<br> \u2014 requires more time than many of us have for your average weeknight recipe. <br> Luckily, I have a solution: Get out your slow cooker and make a huge batch (you can freeze most of it to have on hand for future meals!). <br> The traditional way to make caramelized onions is to cook them ever-so-slowly on the stovetop over low heat until their sugars caramelize, turning the onions golden-brown and completely tender. Low and slow? This sounds to me like a job tailor-made for the slow cooker! <br> Indeed, the slow cooker takes the lengthy task of caramelizing onions and does all the work for us. Fill the cooker with enough sliced onions to make it half or three-quarters full, about three to six onions depending on the size of your slow cooker. Put the lid on, set the timer for the longest, slowest time allowed, and let those onions simmer away. <br> It\u2019s almost impossible to overcook these onions, but I\u2019ve found that 10 hours makes soft, lightly browned onions that still have a bit of bite. These are perfect for adding to soups and topping sandwiches. For jammier, even more deeply caramelized onions, continue cooking for another few hours, but this time leave the lid ajar so the liquid can evaporate. (Any liquid remaining after cooking is fantastic added your next soup or risotto, by the way.) <br> Given the \u00fcber-long cooking time, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s easiest to let the onions cook overnight. Choose a night when you\u2019ll be around in the morning in case you want to cook the onions an extra few hours. <br> If you\u2019re planning to freeze a portion of your batch (and you should!), I recommend freezing them in containers of multiple sizes: ice cubes of caramelized onions are great for last-minute burger and sandwich toppings, cup-sized portions can be used for pizza and pasta toppings, and larger containers are perfect to throw directly in a soup. <br> Even if you don\u2019t have immediate plans for your caramelized onions, having a few bags stashed away in the freezer is never a bad thing. I go by the Boy Scout motto: Be prepared. You never know when those onions will save the day \u2014 and your dinner. <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the home?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

        "<br> A phenomenal classic Caesar salad is sort of like a unicorn \u2014 they are both rare and elusive, some doubt that either exists \u2014 but a really good Caesar salad is much easier to find than a unicorn. The tools and ingredients needed to make an exceptional Caesar salad can be found in almost every kitchen, and the techniques are essentials every cook should know. <br> Make the best <br>from-scratch croutons on the stovetop<br>, make a <br>classic Caesar dressing<br>, and put them both together on a bowl of romaine that has been properly prepared and enjoy a unicorn-like Caesar salad of your dreams. <br> Stovetop croutons are the best croutons for Caesar-salad making. Nothing against store-bought croutons, it\u2019s just that stovetop croutons made from leftover bread are infinitely more tasty and easily customizable. Plus, they only take about 10 minutes to toast up and don\u2019t require heating up the oven. Croutons for Caesar salad can be made up to a few days in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature. <br> <br>Get a Recipe: <br>How To Make Stovetop Croutons<br> <br> Caesar salad is all about that classic creamy dressing. The dressing should have plenty of garlic and Parmesan cheese, a bit of briny anchovies, and lots of black pepper. This classic uses raw egg yolks to build a creamy emulsion without any cream. Use pasteurized egg yolks if you are feeding this salad to the very young or elderly, or feel uncomfortable with raw egg yolks. <br> <br>Get a Recipe: <br>How to Make Classic Caesar Dressing<br> <br> This is may cause some controversy, but the best Caesar salad has cut (not torn) romaine lettuce. Cutting the lettuce keeps it colder than man-handling it does, plus it guarantees uniform pieces of lettuce that are easy to eat. Cut the romaine into bite-sized pieces and wash under cool running water before drying throughly (a salad spinner is best, but laying on paper towels and patting dry works too). Wet lettuce prevents the dressing from coating the lettuce well. <br> Assembly is a small step in success to the ultimate Caesar salad. Toss the romaine with the dressing first, and then add the croutons and toss again. Add some shaved Parmesan for both garnish and seasoning \u2014 Parmesan is salty, so taste and adjust seasoning after adding the cheese. Serve the salad as soon as possible after assembly. After all, crisp (not wilted) romaine is one of the hallmarks of an exceptional Caesar salad. ",

        "<br> Way back when, in the practically prehistoric days of the internet (I\u2019m talking 2009 here), we ran a reader recipe contest. <br>Quick Weeknight Meals<br> gave us a nice collection of really memorable and delicious weeknight meals. Here\u2019s one of my personal favorites: Nicole\u2019s lasagna roll-ups, which boast the trifecta of being easy, quick, and rather good for you. <br> Upon retesting, these pasta pinwheels turned out to be one of the easiest (and tastiest) dinners I\u2019ve made all month, and given that they\u2019re stuffed with low-fat cottage cheese and oodles of spinach. <br> Nicole, the originator of this recipe, said about it: \u201cI adore Italian food, and this is an easy and healthy way to end my day.\u201d <br> I did make a few changes from her original. She used Veggie Shreds; I use plain shredded cheese. She suggests using some dried spices to flavor the filling; I used a couple cloves of garlic, which made these just garlicky enough for my taste. <br> This is just the simplest and easiest way to get lasagna on the table on a weeknight. I made the filling as the pasta cooked, then rolled them up and baked them. My husband \u2014 ever the pasta-lover \u2014 was a fan of lasagna even in this simplified form, and I loved the ease and lightness of the recipe, too. A winner! ",

        "<br> Rhubarb is an odd fruit. To begin with, it\u2019s actually a vegetable \u2014 a vegetable with poisonous leaves. The stalks are crisp and juicy, with a vegetal crunch rather like celery. And yet this prosaic stalk can produce some of the most beautiful and delicious food of the spring season. <br> It\u2019s also far easier to prepare than we realized; this crumble involves no pre-cooking, no stewing. It\u2019s a fast dessert with a delicate sweetness and hearty topping. <br> The minute I polished off my serving of this crisp, I started dreaming about my next serving (which came the next morning, for breakfast). This is such a unique dessert yet it still feels so homey and comforting. Both rhubarb and lavender are assertive flavors \u2014 one tart, the other floral \u2014 yet when they join forces, along with honey, they mesh and mellow and become something delicate and perfect. In fact, the floral notes of the lavender are so understated that guests may wonder what that extra something is that makes this rhubarb crisp stand out. <br> I also really love that strawberry doesn\u2019t stand in the way here, as it does in so many rhubarb desserts. If you celebrate rhubarb as much as I do, I encourage you to make this dessert immediately. Eat it with ice cream tonight and enjoy leftovers for breakfast with a dollop of Greek yogurt. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, May 2018<br> ",

        "<br> Shredded carrots have a firm crunch and sturdy bite that rival all other vegetables, and when they get thrown in a mix like this glorious salad, they are an essential supporting player. But it\u2019s not just about the carrots and their sweetness here in this Thai-inspired hash \u2014 it\u2019s also about the cabbage, the grapefruit, the zucchini, and so much more. <br> <br>Anna Jones<br> is a cook and writer from London who got her start in Jamie Oliver\u2019s restaurants and on his creative team. If you love vegetables, her cookbook <br>A Modern Way to Eat<br> is one to nab. <br> She explains that this salad gets its inspiration from pad Thai. \u201cUnlike pad Thai, though, you\u2019ll notice there aren\u2019t any noodles here \u2014 instead, ribbons of zucchini and carrot take their place. I make this salad all year round: In autumn and winter I swap the basil for more cilantro and the zucchini for celeriac or parsnip. <br> This is a really refreshing, crunchy salad that has a lot going on: sweet zucchini and carrots, mild cabbage, earthy bell peppers, and some sweet-sour zing from grapefruit and lime. The cashew dressing was really easy to buzz together and reminded me of an Asian peanut sauce \u2014 it would also make a great dipping sauce. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, June 2015<br> ",

        "How To Cook Eggs in an Electric Pressure Cooker",
        "<br> The pressure cooker is an old-fashioned appliance that is enjoying a renaissance of sorts, and there are many good reasons why. Chief among them is the fact that it just cooks so many foods so well; if you have a pressure cooker, you know what I mean. You probably had a gateway experience that made you say <br>Oh! This is what this thing can do<br>. <br> For me, that gateway cooking experience was simple and elemental: soft- and hard-boiled eggs. The pressure cooker makes them better than any other method I know. Here\u2019s how! <br> The other reason that pressure cookers are enjoying renewed popularity, in my opinion, is the rise of the electric pressure cooker. Unlike stovetop pressure cookers, which need a little more supervision, an electric model behaves like a slow cooker; you can set it and walk away. It\u2019s a nice blend of old-fashioned technology and modern convenience. <br> The only catch to electric pressure cookers is that they aren\u2019t as powerful as stovetop models, so recipes need a little adaptation. But I haven\u2019t found that to be a problem. I have a Cuisinart pressure cooker and really love it. <br> Whether you\u2019re cooking with an electric or a stovetop pressure cooker, you can be assured that it\u2019s pretty fabulous for eggs. Why? Well, if you eat hard- or soft-boiled eggs daily, as I like to do, it\u2019s<br> a great way to make a big batch at once<br>. <br> But even more importantly, given the steam pressure applied to the eggs, the cooked eggs peel <br>really <br>easily! Here\u2019s a tip test Anjali ran that demonstrates this. <br> <br>Read the tip test: <br>Is the Best Way to Make Easy-to-Peel Eggs in the Pressure Cooker?<br> <br> Ever since I acquired a pressure cooker and saw how easy this was, I was hooked. I consulted a few different sources on cooking eggs in the pressure cooker, and by far the best is Laura Pazzaglia\u2019s Hip Pressure Cooking site. If you\u2019re just getting into pressure cookers, I highly recommend her as a resource. Here are two great posts on pressure cooking eggs: <br> In my own egg adventures, I\u2019ve found some variances from Laura\u2019s guideline \u2014 mostly because each machine is different, and also everyone has different preferences as to how runny they want their eggs. Hence the range of times below. <br> <br>Makes 3 to 12 eggs<br> <br> <br>Ingredients<br> 3 to 12 large eggs<br> 1 cup water <br> <br>Equipment<br> Electric pressure cooker<br> Steamer insert or steamer basket<br> Slotted spoon<br> Large bowl half-filled with cold water and ice <br> <br>General guidelines: <br>You will need to do a little experimentation on the right time for you and your taste. These are general guidelines, but may vary slightly depending on your machine, your preferences, and how many eggs you are cooking at once. <br> <br>Stovetop pressure cooking: <br>Have a stovetop pressure cooker? Check out Laura\u2019s links above for more info on cooking eggs in a stovetop cooker. <br> <br>Storage:<br> Refrigerate cooked eggs in their shell in an airtight container for up to 1 week. ",

        "How To Make Crispy Roasted Chickpeas in the Oven",
        "<br> Those cans of chickpeas sitting in your cupboard have been hiding an amazing secret. Roasted in the oven, chickpeas transform into a crispy, salty, savory snack. So tiny. So easy to eat by the handful. So irresistible. This is dangerous knowledge. <br> If you haven\u2019t yet been introduced to this snack, please allow me to do the honors. Here is our step-by-step recipe for roasting chickpeas in the oven. <br> Oven-roasted chickpeas are about as simple as it gets \u2014 toss with olive oil and salt, roast, eat \u2014 but there are a few key things to keep in mind. <br> First, <br>dry<br> the chickpeas as much as possible. I like to gently roll them between two clean dishtowels. <br> Also, don\u2019t skimp on the<br> olive oil<br>. You can use less, but your chickpeas will be less crispy. <br> Lastly, <br>wait to toss the chickpeas<br> with any spices or seasonings until you pull them out of the oven, otherwise the spices have a tendency to burn and become bitter. <br> Those spices are really where you can have fun with this recipe. I love using spicy chili powder or curry powder. You could also toss the roasted chickpeas with fresh herbs, like rosemary or lemon zest (or rosemary <br>and<br> lemon zest!). It\u2019s hard to go wrong here. <br> Unlike deep-fried chickpeas, oven-roasted chickpeas don\u2019t stay as crispy once they cool, so I recommend eating them while they\u2019re still warm from the oven for optimal crunchiness. This said, once they cool, the roasted chickpeas become intensely nutty and addictively chewy. It\u2019s a different kind of snack, but one that\u2019s equally worthy of your love and affection. ",

        "How To Hard Boil Eggs Perfectly Every Time",
        "<br> Do you know how to make perfect boiled eggs every single time? Let us show you \u2014 it\u2019s so easy with this basic recipe that lets you choose eggs that are boiled hard, soft, or in between. <br> One bad hard-boiled egg can ruin you for life. At least, that\u2019s what I believed until I learned how to cook soft-boiled and hard-boiled eggs precisely how I wanted to eat them. The perfect hard-boiled egg has no green ring around the yolk and the innards are creamy and mellow. And if you\u2019re in the mood, you can stop short of the hard-boil and make a gooey soft-boiled egg instead. <br> Our tried-and-true method for cooking eggs involves covering them with cold water, bringing the water to a boil, and then taking the pan off the heat to let the eggs finish cooking. This is how we hard-boil eggs for Easter or when we\u2019re making <br>deviled eggs<br> for a party, but you can also pull the eggs from the hot water earlier if you\u2019d like a softer yolk. <br> There are some suggested cooking times in the recipe below. You may need to tweak them slightly to get your very own \u201cperfect egg\u201d but these times are a good place to start. <br> Peeling eggs is always the tricky step, isn\u2019t it? Far too often, the shell crumbles in a million pieces and the whites cling tenaciously, giving us a stubbled, unsightly egg. <br> If your aim is beautiful, pristine hard-boiled eggs for deviled eggs or a similar dish, the only sure-fire trick we know is to <br>use old eggs. <br>As eggs age, they gradually lose moisture through the pores in their shell and the air pocket at the tip expands. The pH of the whites also changes, going from a low pH to a relatively high pH, which makes them adhere less strongly to the shell. Farm-fresh eggs will always be tricky to age. Ideally, buy your eggs a week or two before you plan to boil them and let them age in the fridge. <br> We have also found that cracking the eggs (gently!) just after boiling and then submerging them in ice water also helps make them easier to peel. It\u2019s not always a guarantee, especially if your eggs are still fairly fresh, but it helps. Of course, if you\u2019re planning to dye your eggs for Easter, skip the cracking step! <br> <br>This recipe was originally published April 2014.<br> ",

        "How To Make Homemade Sauerkraut in a Mason Jar",
        "<br> When life gives you cabbage, you make sauerkraut \u2014 and homemade sauerkraut is a world apart from the stuff that comes from the grocery store. It\u2019s crunchy and delightfully sour, perfect for topping a round of beer-braised brats or layering into a big sandwich. Don\u2019t worry about needing a special crock or making so much you\u2019ll be eating it for months. <br> Today I\u2019m showing you how to make a small batch of sauerkraut in a mason jar \u2014 it\u2019s just enough kraut to get you hooked! <br> Sauerkraut is often one of the first fermentation projects recommended to curious DIY-ers, and with good reason: It\u2019s beyond easy to make, it requires very little special equipment, and the results are dependably delicious. All you need to do is combine shredded cabbage with some salt and pack it into a container \u2014 a crock if you have one and want to make a lot of sauerkraut, but a mason jar will do just fine for small batches. The cabbage releases liquid, creating its own brining solution. Submerged in this liquid for a period of several days or weeks, the cabbage slowly ferments into the crunchy, sour condiment we know and love as sauerkraut. <br> Sauerkraut is made by a process called lacto-fermentation. To put it (fairly) simply: There is beneficial bacteria present on the surface of the cabbage and, in fact, all fruits and vegetables. <br>Lactobacillus <br>is one of those bacteria, which is the same bacteria found in yogurt and many other cultured products. When submerged in a brine, the bacteria begin to convert sugars in the cabbage into lactic acid; this is a natural preservative that inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria. <br> Lacto-fermentation has been used for centuries to preserve seasonal vegetables beyond their standard shelf-life. The fermentation process itself is very reliable and safe, and the fermented sauerkraut can be kept at cellar temperature (around 55\u00b0F) for months, although those of us without cellars can make do with storing the kraut in our fridges. Besides preserving the cabbage, this fermentation process also transforms it into something incredibly tasty and gives it additional health benefits \u2014 fermented sauerkraut contains a lot of the same healthy probiotics as a bowl of yogurt. <br> At the most basic, all you need is cabbage, salt, and some sort of container to store it while it\u2019s fermenting. It\u2019s important that the cabbage remain submerged in its liquid during fermentation. When making sauerkraut in a crock, you usually place a weighted plate over the cabbage to pack it down and keep it submerged. When fermenting in a mason jar, inserting a smaller jelly jar filled with rocks or marbles in the mouth of the larger jar serves the same purpose. <br> The cabbage near the surface tends to float, so when fermenting in a mason jar, you need to either tamp down the cabbage a few times a day or place a large outer leaf of cabbage over the surface of the shredded cabbage to hold it down. Also be sure to keep the jar covered at all times with a clean cloth or piece of cheese cloth. This will allow airflow, but prevent dust or insects from getting into the sauerkraut. <br> For a small quart-sized batch like we\u2019re making today, the minimum time is about three days, although the kraut will continue to ferment and become tastier for many days after that. As simple as it sounds, the best rule of thumb is to keep tasting the kraut and refrigerate (or take it cellar temperature) when it tastes good to you. The sauerkraut is safe to eat at every stage of the process, so there is no real minimum or maximum fermentation time. <br> Not much! You may see bubbles, foam, or white scum on the surface of the sauerkraut, but these are all signs of normal, healthy fermentation. The white scum can be skimmed off as you see it or before refrigerating the sauerkraut. If you get a very active fermentation or if your mason jar is very full, the brine can sometimes bubble up over the top of the jar. This is part of the reason why I recommend using a larger mason jar than is really necessary to hold the cabbage. If you do get a bubble-up, it\u2019s nothing to worry about \u2014 just place a plate below the jar to catch the drips and make sure the cabbage continues to be covered by the brine. <br> It is possible you might find mold growing on the surface of the sauerkraut, but don\u2019t panic! Mold typically forms only when the cabbage isn\u2019t fully submerged or if it\u2019s too hot in your kitchen. The sauerkraut is still fine (it\u2019s still preserved by the lactic acid) \u2014 you can scoop off the mold and proceed with fermentation. This said, it\u2019s still important to use your best judgement when fermenting. If something smells or tastes moldy or unappetizing, trust your senses and toss the batch. <br> I have been making fermented beverages and foods for years, and I have always been amazed by how easy they are and how delicious the results can be. There are a few resources I turn to again and again: ",

            "While it's fermenting, you may see bubbles coming through the cabbage, foam on the top, or white scum. These are all signs of a healthy, happy fermentation process.

If you see any mold, skim it off immediately and make sure your cabbage is fully submerged; don't eat moldy parts close to the surface, but the rest of the sauerkraut is fine.",

        "How To Cook Pork Chops in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> Here\u2019s one more way to get your pork chop fix \u2014 in the slow cooker! I particularly love this method when there are a few extra people around my table or when I just want to come home to a meal that\u2019s already done. Since you cook the chops on top of a bed of vegetables, this one also comes with its own side dish. <br> Pork chops are so quick and easy to <br>make in the oven<br>, so why bother making them in the slow cooker? I\u2019ll give you the reason I gave myself: sanity. Weeknight dinners always end up feeling so rushed and frenzied, even if I\u2019ve planned ahead. Sometimes so-called \u201cquick\u201d meals like pork chops \u2014 where lots of things happen very quickly \u2014 just add to my stress level. This is why I love the slow cooker: I can do the prep work when it works for me and look forward to just sitting down to a finished meal come suppertime. I know it sounds a bit like a commercial when I say this, but for me, this is my real life. <br> If you have the choice, go for bone-in blade or shoulder chops. These can be hard to find, so snap them up and <br>freeze<br> them when you do. The cut comes from closer to the shoulder (as the name implies!), where the muscles are a bit tougher and have more connective tissue. This is a good thing for slow cooking since it means the cuts become more tender as they cook. <br> Sirloin chops are also a good choice if you can find them. They come from the hip area at the opposite end of the loin region, and also do well when slow-cooked. <br> Second best to blade or sirloin chops are bone-in rib chops. This is what you see in the photos here and can be found at most grocery stores. The loin meat is very lean without a lot of fat or connective tissue, so it can wind up a bit tough and dry. If you are a pork connoisseur and love your chops <br>medium rare<br>, then you\u2019ll want to avoid these chops altogether. If, however, you prefer your pork well-done, then I think you\u2019ll be very happy using rib chops here. <br> Avoid boneless chops all together. The bone acts as an insulator protecting the meat during cooking and helping to slow moisture loss; boneless chops just become chewy and and unsatisfying in the slow cooker. <br> Brining your pork chops is always a good idea, no matter the cooking method, and it\u2019s doubly true here. Not only does brining add good flavor to your chops, but it gives you even more insurance against overcooking. <br> For four pork chops, I use <br>a basic brine<br> of 1/2 cup of salt and eight cups of water. Dissolve the salt in the water, pour it over the chops, and refrigerate for up to four hours. Rinse the chops off and pat them dry before cooking. Far from being salty, your chops will be seasoned perfectly through and through. <br> I give quite a range of cooking times for this recipe: anywhere from two to six hours at low heat. This is partly because different slow cookers will heat and cook food at slightly different rates and also because everyone likes their chops cooked a little differently. Consider your first batch of pork chops a trial run \u2014 plan on being around to check how they\u2019re cooking and keep track of the time. After this first batch, you\u2019ll know exactly how much cooking time to plan for going forward. <br> At two hours in my slow cooker, my chops have a texture similar to chicken breast \u2014 tender, but firm. Cooked longer, from three to six hours, the texture ends up more like pulled pork; the meat starts falling off the bone and I can cut it with just a fork. (I don\u2019t recommend cooking the chops on high heat. I feel this cooks the chops too quickly, at which point, I feel you\u2019re better off just following the <br>oven-cooking method<br>.) <br> Since pork chops lack the fat of the cuts <br>used for true pulled pork<br>, chops cooked longer than two hours tend to taste a little chewy and dry despite the fact that they are fork-tender. To make up for it, spoon all that delicious cooking liquid over the chops to give them some extra moisture. Or even better, use the cooking liquid to make a quick gravy! <br> As I said above, if you love a really good pork chop \u2014 cooked until just barely up to temp and still with a bit of pinkish tinge in the middle \u2014 then stick with the shoulder cuts. Even then, you may find the texture a little more firm than you usually prefer. <br> One of the things I love about this particular recipe is that it makes its own side dish. The pork chops cook on top of a layer of vegetables, which get basted in the juices from the chops and wind up incredibly flavorful. You can use almost any vegetable or mix of vegetables here that sounds good to you, as well as fruits like apples, Asian pears, and dried cranberries. One of my favorites is a mix of apple slices and onions. Stick of celery and carrots, chopped potatoes, sliced fennel, or even sauerkraut would also be fantastic. ",

        "<br> Bananas are an amazing fruit. All by themselves they can turn into <br>creamy, delicious ice cream<br>, and eaten alone they are a satisfying snack. But they also do wonders in baked goods: Bananas take the place of sugar, eggs, <br>and<br> fat in these wondrously chewy, yummy snack bars. <br> These bars have no added sugar, you can whip them up in just a few minutes, and they\u2019ll take care of breakfast, after-school snacks, and dessert. Amazing? You bet. <br> There are a few optional ingredients here, like vanilla and nutmeg, that add a little extra dimension, but the essential recipe is really just four ingredients: Bananas, oats, dates, and chopped nuts. (I mean, you could argue that it\u2019s just three: I think you could leave the nuts out without a problem.) The bananas hold everything together, and the dates give a little chewy sweetness. The sweetness is understated in these bars; there is just enough to satisfy a mid-afternoon craving. <br> As you can see these are vegan, and if you use gluten-free oats, they\u2019re totally gluten-free, too. They\u2019re quite adaptable; if you want a little more sweetness you could add a handful of chocolate chips or cinnamon chips. You could add shredded coconut, too, or raisins. <br> They last beautifully and hold together in chewy, satisfying bars. Just right for munching on the go in the mornings, or as a high-energy snack before a run. <br> Bananas, for the win, once again! <br> A wholesome 4-ingredient snack bar may seem too good to be true, but it\u2019s indeed possible. While assembling these bars, I had my doubts \u2014 the oat mixture seemed too thick to actually hold together and I couldn\u2019t imagine how so few ingredients would result in something tasty \u2014 but I was definitely proven wrong. These are simple, humble bars that make for a feel-good breakfast or midday snack. <br> Many of you noted in the comment section that these bars aren\u2019t very sweet. They are intended to be a healthy breakfast or snack, so actually aren\u2019t supposed to be too sweet. Using the most overly ripe bananas you can find will help bring more natural sweetness to them. <br> If you\u2019re still hankering for more, I\u2019ve added an optional honey yogurt glaze that\u2019s drizzled on top of the bars before enjoying \u2014 although I suppose that would make these four-ingredient bars not simply four ingredients, but I think it\u2019s worth it. Beyond lending sweetness, it adds a little protein to things, which is never a bad thing. If you\u2019ve glazed the bars, they\u2019re best stored in the refrigerator, and if left unglazed, they can be kept at room temperature. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, May 2018<br> ",

I sort of missed that moment when everyone learned the glories of a burrito bowl, but with the fast-casual chain scheduled for a four-hour nationwide shutdown today, I thought it might be time to catch up. <br> My fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is quite different. He\u2019s sung Chipotle\u2019s praises countless times, and with that, the wonders of the chain\u2019s simple and citrusy rice. <br> And in developing and testing this recipe, I now get it. The best part about this rice is its versatility. It\u2019s kicked up with citrus juice and cilantro, but not so much that it overwhelms whatever you <br>might pile onto it<br> \u2014 it\u2019s meant to be a bed for a whole lot of other <br>wonderful<br>, <br>flavorful<br> things. <br> The extra-long, thin grains of basmati rice help keep things extra light and fluffy. After the rice is cooked, it\u2019s tossed in the smallest amount of olive oil to keep the grains separated (according to <br>their website<br>, Chipotle uses rice bran oil, although it\u2019s much more likely you have olive oil in your pantry). There\u2019s also the balance that\u2019s found in tossing the rice in both lime and lemon juice. Lime juice lends sweetness and just a touch of bitterness, while lemon juice adds a little sourness. <br> But the real secret to this famed rice isn\u2019t what you may think it is. It\u2019s not some special spice blend or magical cooking method \u2014 it\u2019s a bay leaf. Tuck one into the rice as it cooks and it imparts an herbal, slightly spicy aroma to the end result that will keep those lucky enough to dig into this rice wondering just what it is. ",

        "How To Scramble Tofu",
        "<br> My 6-year-old daughter is currently on a month-long scrambled egg strike. She got tired of our regular morning scrambled eggs, but I still struggle to make sure she gets some protein to fuel her through the morning at school. Enter: scrambled tofu, the quick and easy alternative to scrambled eggs. <br> Scrambled tofu has a similar texture to scrambled eggs, is just as versatile, and is infinitely customizable. With five ingredients and four simple steps, you can have a tofu scramble even on the busiest weekdays. <br> Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did and think that all tofu can and should be scrambled. No, silken tofu does not scramble well, but extra-firm tofu has just the right texture for mimicking scrambled eggs. Using a potato masher to break the tofu up into irregular curds will also give the illusion of eggs. <br> The basic seasoning for a tofu scramble includes olive oil, nutritional yeast, and turmeric. This provides enough flavor on its own, but also gives you space to add in additional ingredients like garlic, red pepper flakes, and herbs. Here\u2019s what the seasoning does. <br> This recipe is a really great base for breakfast. Add cooked vegetables and make a breakfast hash. Put the tofu scramble in a pita with harissa and some fresh herbs and you\u2019ve got a sandwich. Top your avocado toast with this hearty scramble and you\u2019ll feel satisfied (and very on-trend). My favorite way to enjoy it? Rolled in a tortilla with a generous sprinkle of hot sauce. ",

        "How To Make Freezer-Friendly Breakfast Sandwiches",
        "<br> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <br>too<br> extreme to say that this whole concept of freezable breakfast sandwiches has changed my world. Or at least my mornings. Definitely my mornings. Suffice it to say, they are amazing. <br> If you love eggs in the morning, often buy breakfast on the way to work, wouldn\u2019t mind saving a few bucks, or all of the above, then boy oh boy, freezer-friendly breakfast sandwiches are about to make you <br>very<br> happy. Here\u2019s what to do. <br> Before we launch into it, I have to give a huge shout-out to Kitchn reader <br>Schwed<br> for cluing me into the possibility of freezer breakfast sandwiches. I read Schwed\u2019s comment on making these egg sandwiches in <br>Why I Eat Eggs Every Morning<br> and felt like a light bulb went off, followed by a rainbow, followed by a confetti parade. Needless to say, I had to try it immediately, and when I did, it felt like an entire second set of lightbulbs/rainbows/parades went off when it actually worked. Breakfast on rushed weekday mornings, solved. <br> There are a few different ways you can approach the eggs for these sandwiches: make <br>a big scramble<br> on the stovetop, bake the eggs individually in <br>ramekins or a muffin tin<br>, or make a big dish of baked eggs, like a frittata or a souffl\u00e9. After remembering Faith\u2019s recipe for easy, make-ahead baked <br>oven omelets<br>, I decided that was the route I wanted to take. <br> I think baking the eggs in a big pan has a few advantages here. For one, it\u2019s mostly hands-off and fairly fool-proof \u2014 just whisk the eggs with milk, pour them in a casserole dish, and bake for about a half an hour. This gives you time to assemble everything else for the sandwiches, and you can even bake the bacon in the oven at the same time. You can also make perfectly shaped egg rounds using a biscuit cutter or a drinking glass that\u2019s about the same size as your English muffins. It\u2019s super easy, and the egg rounds fit perfectly on the sandwiches. For the nutrition-minded, a 10-egg oven omelet comes out to roughly one-and-a-half eggs per sandwich after cutting. <br> This method does create some scraps, which you can piece together for extra sandwiches if you have more than six English muffins in your package, or you can save the scraps for salads, stir-fries, or other quick meals. <br> You can also use any of the other egg-cooking methods mentioned above \u2014 go with whichever one makes the most sense for your cooking. <br> You may be skeptical of how these sandwiches reheat, and I understand that. Admittedly, they aren\u2019t as good as if you\u2019d made everything fresh that morning, but for a make-ahead sandwich that can go from freezer to microwave to breakfast table in about a minute, I have to give these two thumbs up. The eggs are soft and eggy, the cheese is melty, the bacon is chewy and crunchy. The whole thing works. <br> Personally, I like to remove the English muffin top and toast it separately to give the sandwich some fresh, toasty crunch, but you don\u2019t have to. <br> The recipe I give below is about as basic as you can get, which is how I love my egg-wiches. But there\u2019s also a lot of possibility here! You could whisk some wilted greens, cooked broccoli, or other leftover vegetables into the eggs. You could add a few shakes of hot sauce on top of the cheese. You could go completely gourmet and use brioche buns instead of the English muffins. <br> This is really a recipe that you can take into your kitchen and make your own.

        "<br> With its sweet, delicate flavor of muscat, elderflower cordial is generally known as a mixer for refreshing spring and summer <br>drinks<br>. We also love using it in desserts, such as this lemony sponge cake infused with elderflower syrup and served with a dollop of sweet whipped cream. <br> Based on Delia\u2019s Smith\u2019s classic Victoria sponge, the cake is light and moist with a burst of lemon from added zest and a drizzle of elderflower-lemon syrup soaked into the cake after it bakes. Served with fragrant elderflower cream, it would be lovely for a spring occasion, or when you\u2019re watching a certain <br>Royal Wedding<br>. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s Wedding Cake Is So Stunning<br> <br> If you have access to elder trees, which bloom from about April to June, we highly recommend making your own elderflower cordial from the blossoms, sugar, lemons, and citric acid (some people also add oranges). We use recipes from chefs <br>Matt Tebbutt<br> and <br>Sophie Grigson<br>. Otherwise, we suggest bottled <br>Elderflower Cordial from Belvoir Fruit Farms<br>, or you could use another brand or even <br>Fl\u00e4dersaft Elderberry flower drink concentrate from IKEA<br>. <br> An elegant elderflower and lemon syrup gives this cake the royal treatment, while a splash of elderflower in the whipped cream puts it over the top. We made this recipe more reliable by calling for all-purpose flour and baking powder rather than self-rising flour, whose leavening can lose its lift if stored for too long. Add the eggs <br>very slowly<br> to ensure they emulsify into the batter (this can take up to five minutes), otherwise the batter will appear curdled. <br> Elderflower cordial is a non-alcoholic simple syrup, whereas an elderflower liqueur, like St. Germain, is a sweetened alcoholic spirit. Use them interchangeably for soaking the cake, but add a touch of sugar to the whipped cream if using the liqueur. <br> \u2013<br>Patty<br>, May 2018 ",

        "<br> Pasta salads are infinitely flexible, delicious, and ready be dressed up. When I get a crush on a cheese or a vegetable, the pasta salad plays impresario, showing off its charms. But I can get easily carried away; if goat cheese, why not Parmesan too? A handful of dried fruit, toasted pecans, three cruciferous vegetables, and a gilding of bacon, and pretty soon we\u2019re in the third ring of a salad circus. <br> While elaborate salads are delightful, there are times, like right now in picnic season, when it is better to strip it down to the basics and keep it simple. This reader favorite has a mere handful of ingredients, but they\u2019re winners \u2014 feta, olives, snap-tender broccoli, and colorful pasta. This is the easy pasta salad party you need this week. <br> This salad comes from my mother, who whipped it up for a Sunday lunch with family. It scales nicely (lunch at our house usually involves <br>at least<br> 14 people) and the simple ingredients go a long way in flavor. <br> This makes a fabulous lunch, too; add a few strips of grilled chicken, if you like. It\u2019s good cold, warm, or hot \u2014 the mark of a most excellent pasta salad, in my opinion. I prefer it just a little warm, with the broccoli still snappy. <br> This is a simple pasta salad that\u2019s easy to love. Broccoli adds wholesome crunch, olives lend a briny bite, and crumbled feta contributes plenty of salty goodness. Once you\u2019ve made this, you\u2019ll hardly need to refer to the recipe again when making it a second time \u2014 and I guarantee there definitely will be a second time. While the recipe calls for tri-color pasta, if all you happen to have on hand is regular, you can of course use that to no harm except a slightly less colorful bowl. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, May 2018<br> ",

        "Recipe: Lemony Ricotta Pasta with Basil",
        "<br> I learned this treatment for pasta from an old neighbor of mine who took his cooking very seriously and made even the simplest meal seem like a dinner party. Music gets changed, cocktails are poured, stories told; there\u2019s a lot of gesticulating. <br> But really, all there is to this dish is boiling the pasta, tossing the sauce ingredients into a big bowl, and then tossing in the drained pasta. It\u2019s a stress-free party dish, or even just your dinner tonight. <br> This pasta can be pulled together in as long as it takes the pasta to cook; between 9 and 13 minutes, depending on the shape you use. Because it is so simple and the uncooked sauce has so few ingredients, using the best-quality ingredients you can find makes a difference \u2014 especially when it comes to the ricotta. If you can avoid the skim-milk and commercially made versions, do. If you have time, you can even <br>make your own<br>. <br> The pasta shapes that best complement this sauce are small-shaped pieces, like rotini, penne, fusilli, and gemelli; these shapes hold the sauce. Again, quality makes a big difference here. Now\u2019s the time to spring for something better than plain-wrap spaghetti. However, if it\u2019s all you have, you\u2019ll still be eating well. <br> I am on board for anything that involves ricotta, so I was thrilled to finally give this recipe a try. It\u2019s as simple as you\u2019d think it is, and that\u2019s what makes it so special. I was able to assemble everything in under 15 minutes, and yet sitting down to a bowl of this pasta still felt special and a bit fancy. <br> Based on previous comments, I did lower the amount of ricotta cheese so that the pasta wasn\u2019t swimming in sauce, and I decreased the amount of olive oil to just a finishing drizzle, as the dish is plenty luxe and rich without the original couple of tablespoons. <br> It\u2019s worth it to use good-quality ricotta here, so try to seek out the best you can find. I also used Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan, which is a bit saltier and nuttier, and it gave the pasta a bit more dimension (although if all you have is Parmesan, this dish will still be great). <br> Finally, I couldn\u2019t resist adding a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat to cut through the creaminess, but of course I left it optional, if you\u2019re not up for spice. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, May 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make the Best Iced Coffee",
        "<br> Summer is coming and it\u2019s going to be hot. The kind of hot that makes you not even want to go outside. The kind of hot that makes you consider a mesh top as work-appropriate attire. It\u2019s OK, though. I got your chill pill. It\u2019s a cold brew French press recipe that makes the best iced coffee, and it can be your new morning breeze. <br> If you are determined to kick the coffee shop habit and make your own cold brew iced coffee at home, flavored the way you like it, strong and heady and above all <br>cold<br>, I\u2019m here to help. <br> Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: Great iced coffee is not had by plunking ice cubes into a glass of hot coffee. Not at all. If you\u2019ve ever tried that, you know that the coffee is immediately diluted by all that ice, and it never achieves true chilly nirvana. <br> Instead, the best iced coffee is made by changing the coffee-brewing process itself. Instead of using hot coffee, fresh from the pot or the French press, I make a <br>cold-brewed coffee<br>, steeped and chilled overnight in a French press. It emerges from the refrigerator extra-cold and extra-strong, ready to be diluted just a little by your ice and milk. <br> As you may imagine, making a cold-brew French press means using cold water. It also means more time, as the coffee grounds need more time to steep. Letting it sit overnight is best. But this extra time and cold-brew process also means a more delicate flavor and a less bitter finish. <br> This is how many coffee shops make their iced coffee, that stuff you crave this time of year. They make an extra-strong, extra-smooth, cold-steeped brew that is just as good as hot coffee, but in its own special way. <br> Speaking of a finish, I always enjoy adding a final ingredient or two to the French-pressed brew. Try sea salt, caramel, chocolate sauce, or fudge (or heck, try them all at once). It\u2019s hot out there, remember \u2014 your day deserves a sweet beginning. ",

        "How To Make an All-Star Baked Ziti",
        "<br> The smell of pasta, tomato sauce, and cheese baking together is one of life\u2019s most comforting scents. I know that what\u2019s going to come out of the oven will appeal to adults and children alike, feed a crowd without breaking the bank, and be just plain delicious. It\u2019s no wonder that baked ziti is the go-to for potlucks. <br> Here\u2019s how to make an all-star pan of baked ziti \u2014 one that\u2019s never dry, made with a generous amount of cheese, and layered for the ultimate eating experience. <br> Lasagna and baked ziti share a lot of the same ingredients, but I find that baked ziti is a lot easier to throw together and serve. Because you don\u2019t have to wrestle pasta sheets or lasagna noodles or spend a lot of time layering everything together, baked ziti gives you the same satisfaction of eating lasagna, without all the fuss. <br> The main problem I\u2019ve always had with baked ziti is dryness since the pasta sucks up a lot of sauce while baking. The easy remedy is to be generous with the sauce. If you want to be ambitious and make your own marinara, more power to you \u2014 your ziti will be amazing. I\u2019ve been happy with using a good-quality store-bought marinara, however, and just doctoring it up with saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic. <br> <br>Going homemade? Make this sauce: <br>Marcella Hazan\u2019s Tomato Sauce<br> <br> Ziti is straight-cut tubes of smooth pasta, and the tubes are super important because they trap in sauce and little nuggets of cheese. Penne, which is tubes of pasta cut at a diagonal, tend to be easier to find and can be textured with ridges on the outside, trapping even more tasty sauce. Either type of pasta will work beautifully here. <br> <br>Our pasta crush: <br>The Everyday Pasta Brand Italians Buy ( & You Should Too)<br> <br> In my opinion, it\u2019s mandatory for a good baked ziti to have three cheeses \u2014 and this is not the time to be skimpy with how much. Use mozzarella because it melts beautifully, Parmesan for depth of flavor, and ricotta for some creaminess. <br> Ricotta is the defining cheese of baked ziti and I can\u2019t imagine not using it. Its downfall is that it can bake up into a dry and grainy layer. Some people work around that by adding an egg to the ricotta or even substituting with cottage cheese. I love the flavor of ricotta, though, so I\u2019ve found that the simple step of folding the ricotta into the pasta and sauce instead of layering it solves the problem and distributes it evenly without any dry bits. Plus, one less ingredient to layer in the baking dish! <br> The first time I made baked ziti, I made distinct layers of ricotta and a thick topping of sauce and mozzarella on the top, but those layers just didn\u2019t work. I ended up with dry ricotta and mozzarella that didn\u2019t distribute itself evenly into the whole dish. Some bites were just cheese and sauce, and some just pasta. So I had to go back to the drawing board. After some tinkering, I figured out how to put the whole dish together in a better way: <br> At its core, baked ziti is just a pasta casserole, but one that\u2019s a potluck favorite because it can be a hearty side dish or do duty as the main course. Yes, it\u2019s not the fastest dish to throw together, but it can be made ahead and reheated or even frozen for an easy weeknight meal. It\u2019s also adaptable to the crowd you\u2019re feeding or whatever ingredients in the fridge need to be used up. <br> Since I have a small household of three, I like making baked ziti in two smaller baking dishes, then freezing one for later. I\u2019ve even given baked ziti to families with newborns, and it\u2019s a joy to see the parents\u2019 eyes light up when they receive it. Baked ziti bliss! <br> Living up to its name, this baked ziti is everything a pasta casserole should be: cheesy, saucy, comforting, and filling. The standout step is tossing the pasta with some of the sauce, and then folding in the ricotta and Parmesan cheeses. This prevents the pasta and ricotta from drying out and guarantees bites of pasta, sauce, and cheese in every forkful. Folding in the ricotta leaves beautiful pillows of ricotta dispersed here and there throughout the casserole. I won\u2019t blame you for going back for seconds, heaven knows I did. \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, May 2018 ",

        "<br> All too often you don\u2019t want to be bothered with assembling separate elements of a meal. For those times, there are all-in-one dinners like this. Tender Broccolini, spicy chicken sausage, and orzo pasta come together in one skillet to make a creamy, satisfying dinner that only requires a bowl and a fork. <br> Tiny orzo really can\u2019t be beat. It cooks up ridiculously fast, and even picky eaters tend to love its tender, rice-like bite. Here, it\u2019s simmered right in a skillet of saut\u00e9ed Broccolini and chicken sausage with chicken broth. The orzo not only picks up the flavor of these ingredients, but as it absorbs the broth, it also releases some of its starch, which makes for a skillet dinner that\u2019s creamy and almost risotto-like. Stir in some grated Parmesan cheese for good measure and you\u2019ve got a meal that everyone will gather around the table for. ",

        "<br> There\u2019s so much to love about the classic Italian-American combination of pasta and meatballs \u2014 the simplicity, the ease of customization, and the absolutely delicious way it perfumes your house with cozy smells. This time around, double down on everything you love about this combo in the form of a baked casserole to serve the hungriest of crowds. <br> To keep things interesting we\u2019re introducing a smoky element with the addition of canned, fire-roasted tomatoes. <br> A pasta bake is by far the easiest way to serve up carbs to a crowd. Plus, no one is going to complain about those crispy, crunchy bits of pasta you get around the edges of the casserole. This one relies on frozen meatballs to make it extra hearty and extra simple to assemble. <br> But the real intrigue here is the smoky factor, achieved by using fire-roasted tomatoes. Nutty fontina cheese joins the crowd to both balance and complement the smoky flavor, and a few big handfuls of baby spinach wilt right in to add that splash of green that makes this pasta bake wholesome. <br> Swap the standard spaghetti for tender penne, tuck in tiny meatballs, and dress it all in a smoky tomato sauce and top it with a layer of melted and golden-brown cheese? Yes, please! <br> Fire-roasted tomatoes and frozen meatballs weren\u2019t always staples in my kitchen, but I have found that keeping them on hand is an easy way to upgrade dinner with zero extra effort. The first time I made this recipe, I could not get over the flavor, but I found it a little dry and meatball-heavy. Using two cans of fire roasted tomatoes and just a single bag of frozen meatballs brings the balance back. Smoked mozzarella was on the original ingredient list, but my grocer does not always carry it, and when it does it is often expensive for a weeknight dinner. I find that I actually prefer classic part-skim mozzarella, so the smoky tomato sauce stands out. <br> For my family of four (two bigs and two littles), I split this casserole between two 8\u00d78-inch pans, baking one for supper and sending the other to the deep freeze. <br> \u2013<br>Patty<br>, May 2018 ",

        "How To Make Buttermilk from Plain Milk with Lemon Juice or Vinegar",
        "<br> How many times have you found yourself in desperate need of pancakes, but without the requisite buttermilk in the fridge? Or there\u2019s the other scenario: You want to make a recipe, but you\u2019re reluctant to buy an entire carton of buttermilk when you only need a half-cup. For either situation, I have a solution: It\u2019s easy to make a very quick buttermilk substitute in less than 10 minutes. <br> Whether we\u2019re talking <br>pancakes<br> or <br>quick breads<br>, the role of buttermilk in almost any baking recipe is to add tenderness and lighten the batter. Once the acids in the buttermilk get in contact with the baking soda or baking powder in the batter, a giant fizz-fest takes place. The reaction with the baking soda (or powder) cancels out the sourness of the buttermilk, leaving our baked goods airy, tender, and tasty beyond reckoning. <br> If we don\u2019t have buttermilk in the fridge, the closest substitute would be another dairy product with a little acidity added \u2014 milk with a spoonful of lemon juice or white vinegar does the job quite nicely. This mixture won\u2019t get as thick and creamy as buttermilk, but it will perform its role in the batter just as well. Incidentally, yogurt or sour cream thinned with milk (or plain water, in a pinch) also work well as buttermilk substitutes. <br> Thank goodness for buttermilk substitutes, because a good pancake craving should never go unsatisfied.

        "How To Cook Perfect Steak in the Oven",
        "<br> Here is an absolutely foolproof, easy, and quick way to make a juicy steak with a crisp, peppery crust in the oven. Add a loaf of bread, a salad, and a bottle of wine, and you have an easy and delicious dinner you can make for weeknights and special occasions alike. <br> The first and most important step in <br>cooking<br> a great steak is to <br>buy<br> a great steak. The best way to do this is to go to a local butcher, preferably one who either raises the animals himself or sources them from a local farm, or find a store that sources sustainably and humanely raised meat. Besides being a more ethical buying choice, this meat is usually of better quality and tastes significantly better. <br> I buy my steak from a butcher at my local market, <br>Bluescreek Farm Meats<br>. They raise the animals on a farm nearby and dry-age the beef for at least a couple weeks \u2014 I love their steaks! There is always a difference in taste when buying from good folks like them. <br> Bottom line: Buy the best steak you can. No matter how expensive it is, it will still be cheaper than eating out. Expect to pay top price per pound of steak. If the price seems too good to be true, in this case it probably is. <br> Rib-eye steaks are my personal favorite, although this method will work with any favorite cut of steak: rib-eye, T-bone, filet mignon, strip-steak, or any others. <br> Make sure the steak you buy is at least one-inch thick \u2014 if it\u2019s thinner, shorten the cooking time and check the steak early so you don\u2019t overcook it. Also, buy steaks that have some white fat around the edge and a good amount of fat marbling the interior. <br> One pound of steak will easily feed two, and can be stretched to three or even four people. <br> <br>Read more: <br>Shopping for Steak? Here Are the 4 Cuts of Steak You Should Know<br> <br> This method takes 15 minutes, tops. Have the rest of your meal ready, the candles lit, and the wine poured before you start cooking. You\u2019ll have a beautifully juicy, medium-rare steak, with crisped and crunchy edges, before you know it! This is probably our favorite way to cook a steak \u2014 it\u2019s even easier than grilling. <br> This steak is <br>so<br> quick and easy that it leaves you time for making a little special sauce to go along with it. This can be as simple as great guacamole, or as special as a mustard-shallot sauce. ",

        "How To Make Sugar Buns",
        "<br> Sugar buns are a stunning<br> <br>morning treat, with layers of rich, flaky puff pastry dough swirled with a fragrant sugar mixture and coated in warm butter and sparkling sugar. Consider them the ideal pastry for a fast-and-fancy breakfast treat. They are the easiest way to bring a warm, sugary confection to your mornings (besides picking some up from your favorite bakery). <br> Unlike their cousins \u2014 morning buns, sticky buns, and cinnamon buns \u2014 sugar buns can be made with hardly any planning. In less than one hour and with about six ingredients or fewer, you can have these beauties for breakfast. <br> Sugar buns are deceptive. At first glance, they appear to be a simple treat \u2014 just a standard pinwheel of pastry coated in sugar. But oh, how wrong we are. Biting into a sugar bun reveals its true nature \u2014 all flaky layers of buttery puff pastry, crisp caramelized coating, and warm spices that bloom as you take bite after bite. If you didn\u2019t prepare these yourself, you\u2019d surely wonder how such a delicious treat could be <br>so simple<br> to prepare. <br> Essentially a spin-off of cinnamon rolls, these buns require no kneading, rising, or proofing. You\u2019ll only need a few ingredients, most of which you probably have on hand, and less than 20 minutes to put these together. Better still, you can use a few other doughs that you might have on hand in place of the puff pastry that is called for here, too. <br> The namesake of these buns \u2014 sugar \u2014 plays two roles in the baking of these treats. First, the sugar combines with butter while baking to create a candied, caramel-like layer on the bottom of the buns while also turning the almost-savory puff pastry dough into something dessert-like and sweet. Then, as a finishing step, the buns are coated with more sugar \u2014 not only for a sparkling finish, but also for some added texture so they crackle and shatter in all the right places when you take a bite. The resulting buns coat your lips in sweetness without being overtly sweet. <br> What sugar or sugars you use is up to you and what you have on hand in your pantry.<br> <br>I love a combination of white and brown sugar, for an almost caramel flavor, but you could use date sugar for the white sugar and maple sugar in place of the brown sugar for a richer flavor. Topping these buns post-baking with demerara sugar gives them some sparkle and texture, but isn\u2019t required. <br> Store-bought puff pastry is the secret shortcut for these fast, easy buns. Puff pastry delivers flaky layers and buttery richness to the finished buns without the work of making a laminated dough. You can find it in the freezer section at just about every major grocery store. <br> Puff pastry is made from a simple dough folded with layers of fat \u2014 butter and shortening are most commonly used. The dough and fat are folded over and over creating dozens of thin layers that puff and separate when baked. Freezing and keeping puff pastry cold helps with this puffing effect. Seek out puff pastry made from all butter \u2014 these are a higher-quality and, not only do they taste better, but they also puff higher. Puff pastry isn\u2019t fussy, but it does have a few particulars. Here are some tips to help you handle it like a pro. <br> Puff pastry is something that I always keep on hand, but maybe you don\u2019t. You can make sugar buns with three other ready-made doughs. Here are three alternatives that I\u2019ve had success with over the years. ",

        "<br> This Riesling rhubarb crisp cake has it all: tender white cake, rhubarb-strawberry compote and matching buttercream, a crispy oat crumble, and a fanciful, ruffled finish. It\u2019s the perfect cake to bake when you\u2019re feeling like showing off your cake-baking skills or looking for a weekend project to tackle when you want to spend the day in the kitchen. <br> If there is one thing we know about layer cakes, it\u2019s that it\u2019s okay to gradually work up to incorporating all of these elements at once. Give yourself permission to work at your own skill level and only use the bits and pieces you are comfortable with to make this cake your own. <br> Don\u2019t have time to make the oat crumble, or the ruffled finish doesn\u2019t fit your design aesthetic? That\u2019s totally okay! Feel free to leave an element out this time or switch up the style of frosting. It\u2019s more about taking the skills and design inspiration to customize your own creation. However, if you want to go all out, we certainly support that too. <br> When all of the flavors and textures come together, this cake is otherworldly. The earthy tang of rhubarb mixed with sweet strawberries pairs beautifully with crisp Riesling in the summertime. Made with egg whites and a cup-and-a-half of sweet Riesling, the cake itself is light and tender. Serve each slice with a side of leftover rhubarb compote for an extra pop of flavor and color. <br> Taking inspiration from a baked fruit crisp, we\u2019re adding handfuls of homemade oat crumble between the layers of cake and rhubarb buttercream for an added crunch. Who ever said streusel was just made for topping? Make a double batch and toss leftovers on anything from yogurt to roasted stone fruit to ice cream. (Or just eat it straight from the jar.) <br> What\u2019s an elaborate cake filling without an intricate exterior to match? This grand finale of a cake has equally impressive buttercream details as the mouth-watering flavors inside. Using a pastry bag and a petal-shaped piping tip, rows of overlapping horizontal ruffles encircle the entire cake. <br> While they may look delicate and, well, complicated, applying different amounts of pressure on the piping bag in conjunction with the petal tip is all it takes to create the elegant, frilled edges. Keeping the rows of ruffles as even as possible will keep the whole cake looking amazing, even if each individual ruffle is not perfect. Not really your style? Switch out the piping tip and explore a variety of other textures to pipe on the cake, or grab an offset spatula and make swoops and swirls for a rustic, homemade look. ",

        "Recipe: Mango Chicken Breakfast Sausage",
        "<br> Last year I spent a glorious week in Hawaii with my family, complete with a rather deluxe breakfast buffet. My husband was totally in heaven, but I typically find your average breakfast buffet a bit of a minefield. Given our allergies, I have to gently guide my daughters and myself past the sticky buns (gah!) and the bagel bar (sigh \u2026 ) as well as the line for the fluffy custom-made omelets. <br> I\u2019m not sure about you, but I need protein with my morning breakfast or I will be a shaking mess come noon, with snacks hanging from my every pocket. <br> My 5-year-old, Coco, had about seven pieces of bacon on her plate in three seconds flat (she is quite the carnivore). However, I found something much more interesting and ultimately very delicious: mango breakfast sausage links. I tasted them and was beyond excited! It turns out the chef was making them by hand each morning with fresh mango from a local farm; I was totally hooked, and the kids and I ate them every morning for a week. <br> I was inspired, and the minute I got home, I was all over figuring out the perfect recipe for my own mango breakfast sausage. Pork breakfast sausages with apples and other fall and winter seasonal fruits and herbs were a family staple, but I had never thought about the possibilities of doing the same with fresh spring flavors. The mango changed all that with its sweet, bright juiciness. I chose to make it with chicken, because I appreciate the leanness of the protein and I think it is a nice mild pairing that lets the mango really shine. <br> While I hope that you will try this particular combination, other proteins like pork or turkey work too. And feel free to try apples, pears, or persimmons when we get to the colder months! Fresh sage, chives, and rosemary all make wonderful additions, too. It\u2019s really about experimenting and figuring out what you and your family love. <br> <br>Serves 4 to 6<br> <br> 2 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided<br> 1/2 cup very finely diced yellow onion<br> 13 ounces ground chicken<br> 1/2 cup finely diced fresh mango<br> 1 tablespoon minced, seeded red Fresno chile<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives<br> 2 tablespoons dehydrated potato flakes<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt <br> Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy skillet until shimmering. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until soft and tender, about 5 minutes. <br> Scrape the onion into a medium bowl. Add the chicken, mango, chile, chives, potato flakes, and salt. Using clean hands, mix everything together really well. Form the mixture into 6 to 8 equal-sized patties or logs. Set them on a plate or a sheet of wax paper. <br> Heat the same skillet or griddle over high heat. When the pan is really hot, reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Gently place the sausage in the pan and cook until golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are just cooked through. Serve hot. <br> <br>Storage: <br>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. <br> <br> <br>Reprinted with permission from <br>Pure Delicious<br> by Heather Christo, copyright (c) 2016 by arrangement with Pam Krauss Books and Avery Books, members of Penguin Group (USA) LLC, A Penguin Random House Company.<br> <br> ",

        "How To Make Crispy Tofu Without Deep-Frying",
        "<br> Most foods are made exponentially more tasty once deep-fried (hello, <br>state fair food<br>), but I feel that this is especially true for tofu. A crispy coat somehow transforms these wiggly little cubes into something rather magical. <br> But deep-frying tofu is a little much for an average weeknight. Here\u2019s how to achieve crispy tofu perfection at home with a lot less fuss. <br> There are basic cooking techniques we commit to memory \u2014 <br>how to boil an egg<br>, <br>how to make pesto<br>, and <br>how to make no-time bread<br>. Let\u2019s add this simple method for crispy tofu to that list. <br> There\u2019s no way I\u2019m deep-frying on a weeknight (unless there are doughnuts involved), so perfecting that crispy crust on a slice of tofu with just a sprinkle of cornstarch seems like a miracle. It just takes four simple steps \u2014 press, slice, coat with cornstarch (or arrowroot powder), and pan-fry \u2014 to transform tender tofu into bite-sized crunchy bits. <br> Besides being a little easier for your average weeknight, pan-frying tofu has the added advantage of using less oil. Crispy tofu that\u2019s still ostensibly healthy feels like a win to me. <br> I\u2019ve also been playing around with ways to season the tofu before frying it. A sprinkle of salt does the job quite nicely, but tofu is really a blank slate and it\u2019s fun to play around with flavors. After pressing, try tossing the tofu with a little soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil \u2014 or any other seasonings that sound good to you. Let the tofu sit for a few minutes to absorb the seasonings, then carry on with pan-frying. <br> If you\u2019re looking to prep this tofu in advance, press, cube, and flavor it before freezing. Then you can thaw the small cubes quickly before pan frying. <br> <br>Read more:<br> <br>Yes, It\u2019s OK to Freeze Tofu (and It Actually Has One Big Benefit!)<br> <br> One final note: Serve the tofu within an hour or so for maximum crispiness. If refrigerated, the pieces will lose their crispiness and become chewy. If you have leftover tofu, though, don\u2019t toss it! I have a deep fondness for these no-longer-crispy tofu cubes and love their savory chew in a quick rice bowl or lunch salad. <br> <br>This post has been updated \u2014 originally published March 2014<br> ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Pork Carnitas",
        "<br> We started this website to help people cook more often and more joyfully, with the idea that the kitchen is the hearth of the home, the warm place. It is by spending time there that we connect and grow. <br> But sometimes it gets so hot in the summer, you have to draw the line. A few straight days of humidity and 90\u00b0F weather, and I do not feel like being in the kitchen at all, let alone putting together a big meal. <br> A few years ago, in the dog days of summer, when the temperatures didn\u2019t dip below 90\u00b0F for a few days straight, I did something you might think was nuts: I slow-cooked a pork butt. Now, whenever I have a crowd to feed and it\u2019s \u201ctoo hot to cook,\u201d it\u2019s the slow cooker that does the work. <br> Here\u2019s my plug for using your slow cooker in the heat: You can make a lot of food at once without heating up the whole house. You can also do any grunt work \u2014 and for these carnitas, smashing some garlic is the only real work \u2014 in the morning when it\u2019s cool, and set the cooker to work during the day, or you can prep in the evening and set the cooker to work while you sleep. <br> You really don\u2019t need a recipe for cooking in a slow cooker. The basic formula is to place spices with the meat in a slow cooker and cover with liquid (broth, juice, wine, beer, etc.). Cook on LOW for the most tender meat. Chicken is done in as little as four hours, while darker meats like longer cooking times. Cooking on HIGH speeds up the cooking, but the meat is not as tender. <br> Here\u2019s an example using my version of carnitas (usually pork simmered in lard, but in this case, slow-cooked in juice and beer). Any of these spices can be left out or substituted; this is just my usual formula. The same goes for the chipotle peppers \u2014 substitute other peppers, or leave them out, although make sure to amp up other flavor agents, like garlic and spices. <br> Sometimes butchers have many sizes of shoulder to choose from, other times the selection is limited to one general size. A smaller piece of meat still works, but may cook faster. <br> The original recipe is unconventional and not a traditional carnitas, to be sure, but this slightly spicy derivation is still delicious in its own right. The cinnamon adds a hint of sweetness, cayenne adds heat, and chipotles add spiciness and smokiness to perfume the tender pork. Feel free to omit any of these if they\u2019re not your speed. <br> Since I like my carnitas browned, I added easy broiling instructions so that you can crisp up the braised pork easily in one big batch after it comes out of the slow cooker. I have half of this stashed away in my freezer for a busy future weeknight, and I can\u2019t wait to break it out and make tacos or a mean dinner salad! <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Christine<br>, May 2018<br> ",

Meanwhile, warm the tortillas one at a time over a gas burner, or stack and wrap completely in aluminum foil and warm in the oven while the carnitas is browning.",

        "<br> There\u2019s something magical that happens when you combine iced tea with lemonade. This refresher, known as an Arnold Palmer, is a classic for good reason. The two drinks bring out the best of each other when combined \u2014 the bitterness of black tea counters the sweet, sourness of lemonade. <br> So, really, how can an Arnold Palmer get any better? By bringing it to the dinner plate. <br> The flavors of the drink \u2014 bitter, sweet, and sour \u2014 are a perfect match for roast chicken. Here the drink is transformed into a brine by brewing a big batch of black tea and adding some lemon juice, sugar, and salt. After bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs have hung out in the brine for a few hours, they\u2019re pan-roasted along with lemon slices that release their juices and caramelize while the chicken skin gets dangerously crispy. <br> The resulting chicken is lemon-tinged, with the flavor of black tea playing casually in the background. Serve it over steamed rice and add a green salad or roasted broccoli, and serve it with a tall glass of this dinner\u2019s namesake drink. ",

I would describe it as part strata, part quiche, with the bread \u201cboat\u201d being an easy way to have a shell without having to make pie dough. <br> Cut crosswise into slices, these egg boats are great for brunch or lunch, or could even make fun finger food at a party! <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, April 2015<br> <br> <br>Serves 8<br> <br>   <br>   2 sourdough b\u00e2tard loaves, or 4 sourdough demi baguettes  <br> 1/2 cup shredded Gruy\u00e8re or Swiss cheese (about 2 ounces)<br> 4 ounces sliced smoked salmon<br> 12 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or sour cream in a pinch)<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 scallions (white and light green parts only), thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons capers, drained<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives <br> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet pan with parchment paper. <br> Using a serrated knife, cut a V-shaped section from the top of each bread loaf, stopping the knife about 1/2 inch from the bottom of the loaf. Remove the loose bread tops, and scoop out a bit of the inside, too, to form the \u201cboats.\u201d Discard the scooped bread (or save it to make homemade breadcrumbs). Place the boats on the prepared baking sheet. <br> Evenly distribute the shredded cheese and smoked salmon between the cavities of the boats. <br> Whisk together the eggs, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, salt, pepper, and scallions in a medium-sized bowl. Pour the egg mixture into the boats, distributing it evenly between them. Scatter the capers atop the egg filling. <br> Bake until the eggs are puffed and no longer jiggle when you shake the pan gently, 30 to 40 minutes. (If using demi baguettes, check for doneness around 20 minutes.) <br> Let the boats cool for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle them with the fresh chives, slice into 8 pieces total, and serve warm. <br> <br>Storage:<br> Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 300\u00b0F oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes. <br> <br>More egg boat fillings: <br>Not into smoked salmon and capers? Try one of these other combinations to dress up your own perfect egg boat. Just place the ingredients in the bottom of the boat before adding the eggs. ",

        "<br> Do you love <br>pasta carbonara<br>, but get a little intimidated by the step that calls for thickening \u2014 not scrambling! \u2014 the pasta with eggs? Love risotto, but don\u2019t want to spend all that time stirring at the stove? <br> Here\u2019s a much easier riff on both carbonara and risotto, made possible with the help of that teeny, tiny, rather magical orzo pasta. This is your 30-minute dinner tonight! <br> As much as I love risotto, the traditional stovetop method takes too long on a weeknight. I love using orzo (a rice-shaped pasta) instead since it cooks quickly yet still has a great texture. <br> We have to give a shout-out to pancetta, which is an unsmoked Italian bacon, in this dish. It\u2019s just plain delicious, all salty and meaty, although you could use regular thick-cut bacon instead if you can\u2019t find pancetta or want a smoky flavor in your orzo. Pancetta perfumes this whole dish with porky goodness. <br> Once the pancetta and some onion have cooked together for a few minutes, the orzo goes in to toast. This toasting adds another layer of flavor to the dish, so resist the urge to skip it! After toasting, the liquid all goes in at the same time, and then the dish just needs some stirring every once in awhile, but you don\u2019t have to baby it like you would a risotto. <br> One thing to watch out for is that orzo cooking times can vary widely depending on the brand. Trust your instincts and add more water if you need to at the end if the mixture seems dry. When the orzo is ready, take it off the heat, stir in Parmesan cheese and parsley, and enjoy this comforting one-pot wonder. ",

        "How To Make the Best Pulled Pork in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> This is tender, juicy, delicious, and versatile pulled pork prepared in a slow cooker \u2014 not barbecue. If you compare this to hickory-smoked, pit-cooked, whole-hog barbecue, you might be disappointed. But if you harness the ingenious method of braising pork in a slow cooker and add one extra step to ensure comparable flavor, you can come home to pounds of delicious pulled pork. Sauce it (or not) and then pile onto buns, drape over nachos, roll into burritos, spoon over rice, stir into recipes, or simply eat straight-up. You will be overjoyed. <br> This pulled pork benefits from a delicious spice rub full of traditional ingredients you find in any good pulled pork. But rubs can rinse away in braising liquid, and with the longer cook time in a slow cooker, this is particularly an issue. To help the rub stick, the pork is briefly roasted in a screaming-hot oven before transferring it to the slow cooker. Now you\u2019ve got rub that\u2019s going to stay firm, and layers of flavor only searing can provide. <br> Tougher cuts of well-marbled and fatty meat \u2014 such as pork shoulder \u2014 are ideal for braising. Calling a shoulder a butt is not an anatomical anomaly. A pork shoulder is sometimes called a butt not because it brings up the rear of a pig, but because pork shoulders were once shipped in wooden kegs called butts. Whereas leaner cuts would grow tough and dry out, braised pork shoulder becomes incredibly tender and tasty. <br> Because slow cookers are designed to cook food at a consistent temperature for hours on end, they are an ideal vessel for perfect braising. To braise means to gently cook food in a little bit of flavorful liquid in a covered pot. Unlike pots set in or on a stove, you can safely leave a slow cooker unattended. You can even leave your house. Keep the cooker set to low; the high setting will boil the meat instead of braise it, so it\u2019s only a quicker trip to an undesirable outcome. <br> Pork shoulder self-bastes and stays moist, and is nearly impossible to overcook. After the meat is done, the fat can be skimmed off the braising liquid. For even better results, refrigerate the pork in the braising liquid overnight. The flavors meld and improve, and the fat collects on top for easy removal. This technique reaps the benefit of the fat during cooking, but reduces calories and mitigates greasiness before serving. <br> It\u2019s not enough to reach only a safe serving temperature when it comes to braising. Tougher cuts must be deliberately overcooked until the collagen breaks down. Pork shoulder isn\u2019t ready to serve until it is tender enough to cut with a spoon and pull apart easily with a fork or tongs. <br> The delicious defatted cooking liquid keeps the pulled pork moist, but you can replace or augment it with a finishing sauce. Barbecue sauce is a reliable and compatible choice, but don\u2019t let it limit your vision and creativity in using the meat. Pulled pork can go in many directions, so experiment with the dozens of ready-to-use finishing sauces and condiments. ",

        "How To Make Delicate, Lacy Cr\u00eapes: The Simplest, Easiest Method",
        "<br> Mastering cr\u00eapes is a helpful skill to have in your cooking repertoire. Cr\u00eapes are an incredibly versatile base for many classic dishes, going from breakfast to dinner to <br>dessert<br> with a change of filling and desire. Although their delicate nature gives them an air of difficulty, the truth is, as long as you know a few key tricks, perfectly cooked cr\u00eapes are also the easiest, simplest kind to make. <br> Somewhere between a pancake and an omelet, cr\u00eapes are made from a thin egg-rich batter that is cooked into a large, thin cake on the stovetop. <br> The most important thing with cr\u00eapes is using a nonstick pan or a well-seasoned cr\u00eape pan. It does not necessarily have to have a commercial nonstick coating like teflon. After all, people have managed to make cr\u00eapes long before teflon was invented. It all but gets rid of any fear of sticking and makes it considerably easier to lift and flip the delicate pancake. <br> There are cr\u00eape pans specially designed for making cr\u00eapes. Besides being naturally nonstick and made of cast iron, they have low sides to make it easier to get a spatula in there to flip them. Strictly necessary? No. Helpful? Sure. <br> If you think you\u2019ll be making a lot of cr\u00eapes or you will use the pan for other things, then go ahead and get one. They often come in carbon steel or cast iron, which can be seasoned to be just as nonstick as the commercial coatings. <br> Another important part of happy cr\u00eape-making is the consistency of the batter. Cr\u00eape batter is thinner than most pancake batters, more like half-and-half than heavy cream. It may almost seem too thin at first, but you will quickly discover that a thin batter is your friend as it spreads quickly and makes a nice, delicate pancake. If your batter seems too thick and isn\u2019t spreading in the pan, don\u2019t hesitate to gently whisk in a few tablespoons of water to thin it out. <br> A blender is the perfect tool for whipping up the batter, although you can also make it by hand using a bowl and a whisk. <br> Cr\u00eape batter must be rested in order to produce light, delicate cr\u00eapes. A half-hour to an hour on the counter is fine, but overnight in the refrigerator is even better. Overall, don\u2019t skip this step! <br> Cr\u00eape batter can be prepared to be sweet or savory. If you are serving them with sweet additions such as sugar, fruit, or chocolate, then it\u2019s nice to sweeten the batter a little with some sugar and a touch of vanilla. If you are going in a savory direction, additions such as snipped chives or other herbs are welcome. <br> It\u2019s nice to cool your cr\u00eapes on a wire rack so that steam can evaporate. If you are stacking them for storage, a smallish square of parchment or plastic wrap between each cr\u00eape is helpful. (It doesn\u2019t have to be as big as the crepe.) If well-wrapped and placed in a sealable plastic bag, they can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days and in the freezer for a few months. ",

        "Recipe: Seared Salmon with Soy, Scallions, and Ginger",
        "<br> Coming from a Cantonese background on my father\u2019s side, I\u2019m no stranger to seafood dishes involving copious amounts of scallions and ginger. It is absolutely one of the best flavor combinations known to man. <br> Traditionally, scallions and ginger are often made into a paste with oil and salt and served with chicken, or stir-fried with shrimp, lobster, or crab. But one of the most common applications of the scallion-ginger magic is a dish of perfectly steamed whole fish smothered with a sauce of soy, wilted scallions, and caramelized ginger. Served at every Cantonese banquet and many a family dinner table, that dish was the main inspiration for this recipe. <br> I love cooking salmon during the week, because it\u2019s so easy to make. We\u2019re all about saving time in the kitchen when it comes to these weeknight recipes. I usually just season it with salt and pepper and sear it in a cast iron skillet. <br> But if you want something really special, you can put that crispy, flaky salmon over a bed of steamed rice, and take five minutes to go that one extra step of making some of that soy, scallion, ginger sauce I was talking about. Spooned over the top of the fish with some chopped cilantro? There\u2019s nothing better. <br> When we were kids, my sister and I would mix just the sauce with a bowl of rice and practically inhale it. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you find yourself doing the same. <br> For more recipes, amusing anecdotes, and a wellspring of advice on Chinese cooking methods and ingredients, check out <br>The Woks of Life<br>.

        "<br> Pasta casseroles are perhaps the ultimate combination of weeknight convenience and homey comfort food. Casseroles like this one don\u2019t take long to cook, and they can be put together the day before and baked or warmed up at the end of a long day. And yet these pasta bakes are comforting and delicious. <br> This one has a double dose of spinach, spoonfuls of pesto, and, yes, plenty of cheese. It\u2019s a whole meal in one dish. <br> I really love spinach in pasta, and this one picks up spinach and runs with it. I start with spinach pasta, green and hearty, and toss it with fresh baby spinach, shallots, and garlic. If you would like to add some meat, stir in finely chopped chicken breast (no need to cook it first; it will cook through in the oven as the casserole bakes). The whole casserole is bound together with a creamy mix of yogurt, eggs, pesto, and a bit of cream. <br> The best thing, though, about this particular casserole is that it is sized down. Most pasta casseroles are designed for a big household or nights of leftovers. This one is baked in a 9\u00d79-inch square dish and will make enough to feed a couple people dinner plus lunch leftovers. If you want more, just double it and put it in a 9\u00d713-inch dish. <br> I crave comforting pasta bakes often, but rarely make them because they\u2019re usually intended to feed a big crowd rather than my small household. This recipe, however, is perfect because it\u2019s built to serve just four. It can easily be doubled, however, if you happen to have more mouths to feed. <br> Many of you previously commented that the ratio of pasta to sauce seemed off and leaving the shallots uncooked resulted in a flavor that overpowered the dish. I reduced the amount of pasta to better feed four and so that every bit is plenty saucy. I also added the extra step of saut\u00e9ing the garlic and shallots before adding them, so that they lose their sharpness and become softened and fragrant. I tossed the spinach into this saut\u00e9 too, just so it wilts and is easier to mix with the rest of the ingredients. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, May 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make No-Knead Bread",
        "<br> You might be thinking that a hearty, rustic loaf of bread like this one \u2014 with its shatteringly thin crust and tender, tangy interior \u2014 requires special equipment or skills or even a bread starter. Nope, this loaf is the simplest bread we know how to bake at home and it requires no stand mixer, no starter, no special knowledge, and no kneading. <br> This is a step-by-step guide for the now-ubiquitous<br> no-knead bread<br>. It\u2019s ridiculously easy, and very forgiving. If you\u2019re intimidated by baking ratios, volume vs. weight, baking scales, and kneading, this is a great recipe to start with. It will give you such a delicious loaf with about five minutes of hands-on time and almost no way to mess it up. <br> No-knead bread was pioneered by bread baker Jim Lahey and went viral about 10 years ago when Mark Bittman published the recipe in the <br>New York Times<br>. This is just about the simplest kind of bread you can make. You basically throw everything into a bowl and mix it up, then sit around, let the yeast do its work, and bake it. But it\u2019s not just a bread for beginners \u2014 those of us who bake frequently also really love this bread. The slow rise gives this bread great flavor, and the baking method gives it an awesome crispy crust. It\u2019s artisan quality with very little effort \u2014 that\u2019s why this recipe is so popular! <br> The recipe I use in this tutorial, by the way, is a slight adaptation of the no-knead bread recipe that appears in the <br>New York Times<br>. This one only takes eight hours to rise, as opposed to the overnight method in the original recipe. <br> Once out of the oven, let the bread cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Any bread not slathered in butter and devoured immediately should be tightly wrapped and stored at room temperature where it keeps well for about three days. After that? Cut it into cubes for the best croutons of your life. ",

        "How To Make the Best Basic Pizza Dough",
        "<br> This recipe for everyday pizza dough is one we\u2019ve worked on together over the years, tweaking something here and adding something there, until finally coming to a consensus. That makes it sound like this recipe might be tricky \u2014 it\u2019s not. In fact, keeping it simple was one of our biggest requirements. <br> This is the dough for your weeknight pizza, and it\u2019s the one that went into <br>The Kitchn Cookbook<br>. It\u2019s easy to make, either over a lazy afternoon at home or to stash in your fridge for later, and it\u2019s super easy to roll out. Top it with sauce and cheese, bake until bubbly, and awesome homemade pizza is yours. <br> We stuck to the true basics with this dough: just water, yeast, flour, and salt. We played with water-to-flour ratios, with adding some olive oil, with the type of flour \u2014 all of which were delicious experiments, I assure you \u2014 but when it came to just your basic, dependable, everyday dough, this was it. Our recipe here makes about one pound of dough (the same as most store-bought doughs), and this will make you one large pizza or two smaller 10-inch pizzas. <br> If you\u2019re feeding a larger crowd or just want extra dough for future pizza dinners, you can double or triple the basic ingredients \u2014 the recipe scales up just fine. <br> You have a few choices with this pizza dough: You can make the dough and let it rise for an hour or so, then proceed with making your pizzas right away, or you can make the dough whenever you have a spare 10 minutes and keep it in the fridge until you need it (up to three days or so). You can even freeze balls of dough for pizza emergencies. <br> We actually like this dough best if you have time to let it chill in the fridge for a day or two. The slow, cool rising time helps to develop the flavors in the dough and gives the crust a better texture. <br> When it comes time to actually bake your pizza, our advice is use a <br>hot oven<br> and <br>keep the toppings basic.<br> Get your oven as hot as it will go \u2014 at least 500\u00b0F, although preferably hotter if you can. This cooks the pizza quickly, giving it a beautiful golden crust that\u2019s super crispy on the outside but still chewy in the middle. The more toppings you add, the more it slows the cooking down, making the pizza limp and soggy, so try to limit your pizza enthusiasm to just a few scattered toppings and some good cheese. <br> Some basic pizza-baking instructions are below. For the full-length instructions, check out this post. ",

        "How To Poach Chicken Breasts",
        "<br> Banish all thoughts of stringy, tough, sad chicken from your mind. For our chicken salad sandwiches and quick weeknight meals, we want nothing but the best. And for that, poached chicken is definitely the way to go. This method is easy, fast, and foolproof. Totally tender chicken breasts that are as good for dinner as they are for lunch the next day? Not a problem. <br> Poached chicken gets some flack for being \u201cdiet food,\u201d and while it\u2019s true that poaching chicken requires no fat for cooking and chicken breasts are naturally lean, there are plenty of reasons why poached chicken can stand on its own. <br> Poached chicken is essential for a <br>good chicken salad<br> (which is most definitely <br>not<br> a diet food!). When sliced, this chicken is also a great add-in to any leafy green lunch salad or sandwich \u2014 way better than deli meat. This chicken shreds beautifully, so I like using it to make a quick BBQ pulled chicken or for weeknight tacos. Also, come cooler temperatures and casserole season, poached chicken is a must-have for many of my favorite baked dinners. <br> Poaching chicken is easy. It involves covering chicken pieces with water and letting them simmer on the stovetop until the chicken is cooked through. The low temperature and moist-heat cooking method cooks the chicken gently and prevents it from overcooking too quickly. The cooked chicken is moist and tender \u2014 the very opposite of tough. <br> To bump up the flavor, I add whatever aromatics I have in the kitchen \u2014 a bay leave, a few smashed garlic cloves, any herbs that need using up. If I have some leftover wine or an open bottle of beer, I\u2019ll add some of that to the poaching liquid, too. All of these will season the chicken as it poaches, making it more flavorful and fun to eat. <br> Poached chicken? Fun to eat? Right on! How do you use poached chicken in your cooking? <br> <br> Makes 1 to 4 chicken breasts <br> <br> <br>Ingredients<br> 1 to 4 skinless chicken breasts (bone-in or boneless)<br> 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt<br> <br>Aromatics:<br> smashed garlic, bay leaf, 1 teaspoon peppercorns, sliced ginger, fresh herbs, thinly sliced onions, or any other flavorings<br> 1 cup dry white wine (optional) <br> <br>Equipment<br> <br>2 to 4-quart sauce saucepan with lid, large enough to hold the chicken breasts in a single layer<br> Instant-read thermometer<br> Cutting board<br> Knife <br> <br>Storage: <br>Leftover chicken can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

        "<br> These bars slip into that magical niche of snacks that seem \u2014 and taste \u2014 like candy but are still, at least ostensibly, healthy. They are made without refined sugar, require zero cooking, and can last in a backpack all day. Packed with peanuts and topped with a thin layer of chocolate, they are also the perfect energy-boosting snack to get you through a workout, an afternoon class, or a weekend hike. <br> These bars are a riff on my favorite <br>3-ingredient energy bars<br>, which use dried dates as both the sweetener and the binder to hold the bars together. Peanuts and chocolate, that much-loved duo, round out the other ingredients here and make these bars taste like a real treat. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not a fan of dates \u2014 these bars don\u2019t taste at all fruity, just pleasantly sweet and chewy. <br> These backpack buddies are also \u201chealthy,\u201d less in the dieting sense and more in the \u201cgood, wholesome ingredients\u201d sense. Use the best ingredients you can find, particularly with the peanuts. Almonds and other nuts also make a fine substitute here if allergies are an issue. Also, use a chocolate that you enjoy eating out of hand. I\u2019m a fan of using a fairly dark chocolate with these as the bitterness cuts the sweetness from the dates. <br> Since the bars are so energy dense, one small bar (or even, really, half a bar!), is enough to satisfy me before a workout. On a recent trans-Atlantic trip, these bars were my savior when the airplane meal options were less than appetizing. <br> I like the dense chewiness of these bars when they\u2019re right out of the fridge, but they last very well at room temperature. They become softer as they warm, so if you can, transport them in a hard-sided container so they don\u2019t get squashed against books or gym shoes in your bag. <br> This post was requested by Aurora Gray and Mary Frances Ellison for Reader Request Week.

        "Recipe: Red Lentil Soup",
        "<br> Lentil soup is comforting, simple, and easy to throw together. It\u2019s my go-to meal when I want something hearty but healthy, when I feel like my body needs a reset from a spate of indulgent eating, or when I\u2019m tasked with feeding vegetarian or vegan friends on a chilly day. This pared-down red lentil version is the one I make most often, and it never fails to please. <br> Red lentils are perfect for weeknights, or whenever you\u2019re in a hurry to get a meal on the table. Due to how they\u2019re processed, de-husked, and split before packaging, they cook up quicker than any other variety of legumes, although they are slightly lower in fiber than the larger whole varieties. Also note that while they\u2019re a lovely salmon pink in the package, their color changes as they cook, fading to a golden-yellow hue as they melt into a soup, stew, or curry. <br> But their speediness is so appreciated. A half-hour is all it takes to go from stovetop to table, and much of that time is unattended. <br> While the soup is simmering, you\u2019ve got some time to figure out what to serve alongside it. I often pair lentil soup with crusty bread, toasting it with a drizzle of olive oil and some shredded Parmesan cheese if I\u2019m feeling indulgent. Slice your bread thick enough to tear off nice big hunks \u2014 perfect for dunking and swiping up the last few drops of soup. <br> As a finishing touch, consider topping your bowls with a swirl of peppery olive oil, a dollop of tangy yogurt, or, my personal favorite, <br>gremolata<br>. This simple combination of chopped garlic, parsley, and lemon zest gives the soup a punch of freshness and brightens up the bowl. ",

        "<br> I didn\u2019t think <br>chicken tikka masala<br> could really get much better, but then I remembered my best gadget friend: the slow cooker. This is a curry dish that benefits from a nice, long simmer anyway, so why not let that happen while I\u2019m off doing other things? That\u2019s what I call smart cooking. <br> Spooned over some steamed rice, this easy slow cooker tikka masala is about to make your busy days very happy indeed. <br> Marinating the chicken in some yogurt while saut\u00e9ing the onions and garlic with the spices helps both flavor the chicken, tenderize it, and help make a thicker finished sauce. Serve this with a simple pot of <br>basmati rice<br> \u2014 if you start cooking the rice at the same time you add the cream at the end of cooking, the whole meal is ready at the same time. <br> Based on feedback from users who have made this recipe, we have retested and tweaked it, starting with saut\u00e9eing the onion, garlic, and aromatics to really develop the deep flavors that are the hallmark of tikka masala. There is also now a spice blend of garam masala, coriander, cumin, and turmeric, and we\u2019ve increased the amount of chicken to feed more people. <br> Draining the tomatoes also helps to reduce the amount of liquid that form the basis of the sauce, and simmering the final sauce uncovered with the cream or coconut milk helps to thicken it. I\u2019ve really enjoyed this with rice or even some naan for dipping! <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Christine<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "Recipe: Ina Garten\u2019s Roasted Vegetable Lasagna",
        "<br> When we shared a menu from Ina Garten\u2019s new book, <br>Make It Ahead<br>, we pulled a few of our favorite recipes and chatted with Ina herself about ways to put them together into a delicious and satisfying vegetarian dinner party \u2014 one that, yes, you can make ahead. <br> The star of the show is this roasted vegetable lasagna \u2014 always a hit! Here\u2019s what Ina says about this dish, with a few smart tips for making it great. <br> In her headnotes, Ina explains, \u201cI\u2019ve wrestled with all kinds of vegetable lasagnas. I love the flavor but the liquid in the vegetables always makes the lasagna watery. To solve the problem, I roasted the vegetables first and didn\u2019t precook the noodles, and the result is a delicious one-dish dinner. Herbed goat cheese, fresh ricotta, mozzarella, basil, and lots of Parmesan make it really satisfying.\u201d <br> Although this lasagna takes some time to put together, I love that you can do it the day before and just bake when ready to serve! It\u2019s definitely hearty and will make a vegetarian crowd very happy. <br> When soaking the lasagna noodles, I found that a really wide pot worked better than using a bowl, as that allowed the noodles to sit flat as they soaked. Before sprinkling the zucchini and eggplant with the seasonings, I found it easier to just mix the salt, pepper, and oregano in a bowl together, rather than sprinkling them all separately. <br> If you don\u2019t have an electric mixer for the ricotta filling, don\u2019t despair! As long as everything\u2019s at room temperature, you can just whisk it together by hand \u2014 it\u2019ll just take a little bit of muscle. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, April 2015<br> ",

        "<br> Are you in the mood for some comfort food? Of course you are. But now that spring is here and summer is on the horizon, you might, however, be leaning towards something with vegetables \u2014 perhaps even a vegetarian dish? <br> I have a proposal for you: fresh baby spinach and chickpeas, slow-cooked with ginger, garlic, and onion in a creamy coconut milk sauce, finished off with a healthy dash of lemon. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. No \u2014 this spicy, tangy dish of greens was designed to be served over a sweet potato. See? Both comforting <br>and<br> your daily dose of vegetables, all in one dish. <br> It\u2019s a mess of colors and vegetables \u2014 green, tender spinach draped over a big, hot sweet potato. <br> <br>Find out how to bake sweet potatoes<br>, step-by-step, <br>right here<br>.<br> <br> This isn\u2019t, by any means, an especially difficult or even original meal; there are scads of recipes out there for greens braised in coconut milk. But I was looking for a very specific taste \u2014 hot and spicy, extra tangy, rich and sweet \u2014 every sense and flavor in the dish amped up to 11, so to speak. <br> The stew itself is a quick one, for something stewed. I pulled it together in about 30 minutes. That is one benefit to using baby spinach, instead of the kale, collards, or turnip greens often called for in this kind of recipe. Those need to cook longer or even be blanched in boiling water beforehand, but the baby spinach cooks much faster. It also wilts down tremendously \u2014 the pound of spinach called for here will look huge before cooking! <br> Poured over the sweet potato, this is powerhouse vegan comfort food, with loads of flavor and solid sustenance from the chickpeas and sweet potato. I haven\u2019t tried freezing the braised greens yet, but I think it would make a great make-ahead and even freezer-friendly meal for winter eating. ",

        "<br> As I flipped with no small pleasure through the pages of Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s cookbooks, considering recipes for this week\u2019s lunch feature, I was looking for recipes that went beyond the obvious: the salads, the soups, the plain sandwiches that characterize my all-too-frequent lunch ruts. But what else is out there? Come on \u2014 give me a new idea. <br> And unsurprisingly, Ottolenghi came through, with this recipe for a cauliflower cake that is good fresh, cold, at room temperature, for breakfast, lunch, or really any time at all. <br> When I asked Ottolenghi about his favorite lunches, he made special note of lunches that can be eaten at room temperature, espcially this one. He also notes the beautiful flexibility of this savory cake in the book\u2019s introduction to the recipe. <br> He continues, \u201cServe this cake as a light supper alongside a makeshift salad of sliced cucumber, dill, mint, a little sugar, cider vinegar, and canola oil. Wrapped well, this cake will taste even better the next day.\u201d <br> This savory cauliflower cake is so tasty that even my two-year-old has been gobbling up the leftovers! Fluffy, tender, and moist with cauliflower but well-seasoned with onion, herbs, and cheese, it was great both warm and at room temperature, and kept well for days in the refrigerator. <br> If you don\u2019t have a springform pan, you can just use a regular 9-inch cake pan or even an 8-inch square pan, like a friend of mine did, instead. As long as it\u2019s lined with a big piece of parchment that comes up the sides, the cake will come right out of the pan. <br> Nigella or black caraway seeds can be hard to find, but you can still make the same great visual impact they do by using black sesame, black cumin, or onion seeds instead! <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, May 2015<br> <br> <br>\u2192 Buy the Book! <br>Plenty More: Vibrant Vegetable Cooking from London\u2019s Ottolenghi<br> by Yotam Ottolenghi<br> ",

        "<br> What is warm-weather cooking, to you? For me, it means keeping things as simple as possible. In the spring and summertime I want meals that come together in one big pot \u2014 easy to cook and easy to reheat later. I want meals that taste like the garden, fragrant with herbs and bright flavors. I want hands-off meals, so I can retire to the back porch with a <br>cucumber gimlet<br> while my supper cooks. <br> Well, this braised chicken dish fits all those requirements beautifully. <br> It\u2019s a simple dish \u2014 it needs just a few ingredients and one big pot. White beans and chicken cook together in the oven with shavings of lemon, which infuses them both with a bright lemon scent. At the end I stir in handfuls of chopped dill and add a swirl of mint pesto \u2014 garlicky and minty. <br> While the recipe calls for small white beans, there are a few that are common on shelves. We recommend navy, as they seem to be the most easy to find, but flageolet or Great Northern are two other varieties you may come across. <br> What are the differences? They all deliver mild flavor and creamy texture, so it\u2019s really just a matter of size. Flageolet are the smallest, followed by navy, and then Great Northern. All three will work well here \u2014 just know that since Great Northern are the largest of the three, they may absorb a little more water, so you might have to add a bit more while they cook to get things brothy. <br> This one-pot meal can be made on the stove or in the slow cooker. Either way, it will yield you herbed, creamy beans and tender chicken, with that garden-fresh taste of mint and garlic at the end. <br> To me, this stew feels like a celebration of spring. The herbs and lemon ensure the dish is super bright and fresh, yet it\u2019s warm and brothy and filled with creamy white beans, which satisfies the comfort we all still crave on the cooler days of the season. The mix of dill, thyme, and mint is a new combination to me and one I\u2019ve now fallen in love with \u2014 the zesty dill and mint are nice contrasts to the earthy thyme. <br> I also love that Faith has already done the work to provide you with slow cooker instructions, so that if you don\u2019t happen to have a lazy Sunday on hand to let this cook in the oven for a couple of hours, you can still toss all the ingredients together on a weekday morning and enjoy the results when you get home from work. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "Recipe: Carrot Cake Power Bites",
        "<br> These snacks are vegan, require no baking, and come together quickly in the food processor \u2014 but best of all, they taste like carrot cake! They\u2019re also made from whole ingredients (with just a teeny tiny drizzle of sugary icing on top), so even though they taste like dessert, they have enough fiber, protein, and fat to keep you ticking right through the afternoon doldrums. <br> My husband, my parents, and four of my most discerning food writer friends all gave these little snack bites an enthusiastic thumbs up. The no-bake dough is moist and soft, with plenty of natural sweetness from cooked, mashed carrots and chopped dates. The cinnamon-spiced dough balls are topped off with a drizzle of vanilla bean icing, creating a taste sensation just like carrot cake with vanilla frosting. <br> Because this dough is so soft and sticky, it doesn\u2019t quite work to roll it into balls with your hands. Instead, scoop up a bit of dough in one spoon and then use another spoon to nudge it into a rough ball shape (check out the photo below). Don\u2019t worry about getting it perfectly round here \u2014 just drop it in some almond meal, sprinkle more almond meal on top, and <br>then<br> use your hands to roll it into a ball. This makes it much easier to shape the sticky dough. <br> These power bites will keep for a few days in the refrigerator, but you can also freeze them for about a month. Freeze them on a baking sheet in a single layer, then transfer them to a freezer bag or tupperware. <br> One last note before we jump into the recipe: These bites are best when eaten straight from the fridge or the freezer, since chilling helps firm them up. They become soft and fairly squishy again at room temperature! If you\u2019re taking them in your bag for a later snack, pack them in a hard-sided container; they\u2019ll squish and flatten if they\u2019re in a plastic bag. ",

        "<br> There needs to be a revolution in the poultry world. While many people think that boneless, skinless chicken breasts are the end-all-be-all for a chicken recipe, chicken thighs deserve the real love. <br> When cooked correctly (which isn\u2019t hard), chicken thighs will make the most succulent chicken you\u2019ll ever eat, with a perfectly crispy skin. <br> The key to cooking chicken thighs is to start them in a cold cast iron skillet. Yep, you read that right. <br>Cold<br>. Season them well with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and then put them skin-side down in the skillet over medium heat. <br> Then just don\u2019t touch them for 14 to 15 minutes. As the pan heats up, the skin will slowly get crispy. It might pop and hiss, but all is good. As long as you watch your heat, it\u2019s almost impossible to burn or overcook these. <br> Once they have crisped nicely in the skillet, dot your thighs with lemon slices and fresh thyme sprigs and finish them in a 400\u00b0F oven for another 13 to 15 minutes, depending on the size. <br> If you\u2019re in doubt on the cooking time, leave them in for another few minutes. It\u2019s very hard to overcook these guys. <br> One or two of these thighs makes a perfect weeknight dinner, with a side salad and maybe a slice or two of garlic bread! <br> I have to give my husband full credit here: He\u2019s the one who discovered this gem of a recipe from the Kitchn archives a couple of years ago and we both got hooked almost instantly. These may look like ordinary chicken thighs, but what makes this recipe so special is the technique. <br> The thighs start skin-side down in a cold cast iron skillet \u2014 yes, cold. As the skillet heats up, so do the thighs, which lets the skin slowly render its fat so that it get ridiculously golden-brown and crispy. Then the thighs are flipped, some lemon slices and thyme sprigs are sprinkled over them for flavor, and the skillet is tossed into the oven so the thighs can finish cooking. <br> Not only does following this method prevent the thighs\u2019 skin from burning or the meat from overcooking, but it\u2019s also so easy to follow that once you\u2019ve done it the first time, you don\u2019t have to look at the recipe again. It\u2019s just 15 minutes on the stovetop and 15 minutes in the oven \u2014 pretty much all hands-off. It\u2019s adaptable, too! Swap in rosemary sprigs for the thyme, forgo the citrus and herbs all together and sprinkle a little cumin or smoked paprika on the thighs before cooking, or just keep them plain and simple with nothing but salt and pepper. This is now our go-to chicken thigh recipe and I hope it becomes yours too. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "<br> I love a little crunch in my tuna salad. I also am not the biggest fan of <br>mayonnaise<br>; I like a dab, but no more. Here\u2019s a tuna salad in that spirit \u2014 fresh, crisp, and light, with more vegetables than tuna in the mix. <br> I used Wild Planet light skipjack tuna for this salad. We\u2019re big fans of Wild Planet\u2019s responsibly sourced canned tuna around here. (Sara Kate mentioned them in her <br>roundup of a past Fancy Food Show<br>.) Their light skipjack tuna is a little more expensive, but it\u2019s lower in mercury than other canned tuna, and skipjack is overall one of the best picks for tuna. <br> Here\u2019s <br>Monterey Bay Aquarium<br>\u2018s Seafood Watch\u2019s take on this variety of fish: \u201cSkipjack tuna caught with troll or pole-and-line gear receive a \u2018Best Choice\u2019 recommendation because there is little or no bycatch associated with this collection method.\u201d <br> All good things, and the tuna itself is delicious. You can see it above, just after I opened the can. A solid mass of tuna! No little flecks and specks swimming in water. <br> I mixed the tuna with a generous quantity of finely chopped cabbage, which makes up the bulk of the salad. The tuna adds protein, and it\u2019s all dressed with just a touch of mayonnaise helped out by Greek yogurt. This lighter approach to tuna salad is simple and fresh; it benefits from a healthy helping of black pepper, too. I\u2019d love to add a little garlic next time \u2014 an addition just for weekend lunches, perhaps! (Tuna <br>and<br> garlic? No need to overwhelm your coworkers!) ",

        "How To Make No-Time Bread",
        "<br> So, by now you\u2019ve tried <br>no-knead bread<br> and <br>no-knead bread in a hurry<br>, a slightly quicker variety, and you\u2019ve seen how easy it is to bake bread at home. The no-knead phenomenon is still going incredibly strong, and we think it\u2019s because it\u2019s taught so many people how easy bread really is! <br> You can play with bread basics and yeast to suit almost any schedule. The one thing you usually need in making bread, though, is time. No-knead bread is delicious partly because of the very long rise. But what if you have a craving for last-minute yeasty goodness? What if you are making dinner and have only an hour or so, and biscuits just won\u2019t do? Introducing no-time bread<br>. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been looking for. <br> If you\u2019re a baker you should be instantly suspicious; time is what generally makes bread good. We can\u2019t promise the incredible slow-rise flavor of no-knead bread here, but you can indeed trick yeast into a fast rise that gives a different but still delicious homemade loaf. <br> The crumb of this bread is much finer than no-knead; the dough is not quite as wet, so it has a finer crumb compared to the rustic wide holes of a wetter dough. <br> And the taste? Obviously it doesn\u2019t have those complex flavors that are born of long, slow rising. Instead it is yeasty and moist \u2014 with just a hint of a tang. We use a little trick from Shirley Corriher, who adds a touch of vinegar to quicker yeast doughs. This simulates a little of the flavor you get in long-rise doughs.

        "Recipe: Thai Ginger Chicken Stir-Fry",
        "<br> As much as I love eating out at fancy restaurants and watching TV shows like <br>Top Chef<br>, the cooking that is closest to my heart is home cooking \u2014 dishes that are humble and maybe a little homely, but feel like the food equivalent of a warm hug. <br> This gingery chicken stir-fry is home cooking at its best: quick and simple to prepare, with a punch of flavor that manages to be both exciting and deeply comforting. Make it once and you might never call for Thai takeout again. <br> This was one of the first Thai recipes I ever mastered and it became pretty much an instant favorite. Like most stir-fries, the ingredient list is short and simple, but a magical transformation occurs once everything hits the pan, resulting in a finished dish that is somehow more than the sum of its parts. <br> Ginger is the key to that magic; along with the umami-bomb combo of fish sauce and oyster sauce, it infuses the chicken and vegetables with a deep flavor in the hot wok or skillet. <br> If you are new to stir-frying, familiarize yourself with the basics in this cooking lesson from stir-fry expert, Grace Young, before you get started. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>How To Stir-Fry Chicken<br> <br> <br>The key points to remember? Cut all your ingredients in uniform, bite-sized pieces; have the meat, vegetables, and sauce prepped and within easy reach once you start cooking; and cook over high heat and give the chicken some time to brown when you initially put it in the pan. <br> And if you already rely on stir-frying for quick, healthy, and satisfying meals, you will be happy to add this gingery recipe to your home-cooking repertoire. <br> The next time you\u2019re seriously considering takeout, I encourage you to try this recipe instead. It will come together faster than the time it takes for your delivery guy to get to you and it will be even more satisfying. <br> Fish sauce and oyster sauce join forces to make one seriously umami-rich sauce for the chicken and veggies that\u2019s accented by spicy, fragrant ginger. While I love the crisp, juicy bell peppers here, I could definitely see this recipe being super adaptable. Next time I plan to try it with broccoli florets that I\u2019ve <br>blanched<br> so they finish cooking quickly in the skillet. I also think adding snow peas or sliced mushrooms would be nice. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "How To Cook Salmon in the Oven",
        "<br> If you want an easy, fancy main dish, it doesn\u2019t get much better than roasted salmon fillets. It can be a midweek date night, an al fresco meal with friends, or dinner with the in-laws \u2014 salmon will rise to any occasion. <br> Today we\u2019re showing you the easiest, simplest way to cook salmon in the oven. It\u2019s the kind of recipe to keep in your back pocket (although it\u2019s hardly a recipe at all). Make it once and you\u2019ll never wonder what to do with salmon again. <br> The key to good salmon is not overthinking it. Today, all we\u2019re doing is rubbing the fillets with a little oil and sprinkling them with salt and pepper before popping them in the oven. Even thick fillets of salmon will cook very quickly so don\u2019t wander too far from the oven. Aim for four to six minutes per half-inch of thickness. Since most fillets are about one inch thick in the thickest part, start checking around eight minutes. When the fish starts to flake easily with a fork and the flesh looks opaque, it\u2019s time for dinner! <br> As with any fish, buy the best salmon you can find and afford. For more information about best practices for buying salmon, take a look at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch page. <br> Salmon is terrific with just a sprinkle of fresh herbs and a wedge of lemon squeezed over top as you walk to the table. If you\u2019re in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz, try serving it with <br>some pesto<br> or a dollop of <br>Italian gremolata<br>. ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Ginger Chicken Congee",
        "<br> If you\u2019re a savory breakfast-lover like me, this chicken congee, which takes less than two minutes to throw into the slow cooker, will make you look forward to waking up and facing the day. The fact that you\u2019re asleep the whole time it bubbles away makes it the ultimate hands-off recipe. <br> My mother didn\u2019t make breakfast very often when I was growing up, but when she did, this congee was one of my favorites. She would put bone-in chicken, rice, and ginger in the slow cooker, top it off with water, and let it cook all night long. In the morning, we feasted on a hot, comforting breakfast, and there would be enough left over for more breakfasts or even lunch. <br> This recipe seems almost too simple, with just three key ingredients, but that\u2019s the beauty of congee. You can actually taste the chicken and ginger, and it\u2019s all suspended in a creamy rice porridge that\u2019s the result of hours of cooking so that the rice is completely broken down. <br> You can eat this congee plain or doctor it up depending on your mood. Fresh toppings like cilantro, scallions, or ginger add a bit of bite and freshness, as do roasted peanuts. You can also add a few drops of soy sauce or toasted Asian sesame oil. Feel free to experiment and find the combination you like best. ",

Bonus: split peas soften while cooked, so you don\u2019t need to soak them overnight! <br> To be honest, I\u2019ve always been on the fence about split pea soup, as it always seemed a bit ho-hum to me, but this recipe changed my opinion. It\u2019s a humble soup, sure, but one that\u2019s bursting with flavor, thanks to the smoked ham hock that simmers away with the split peas. While you can surely leave it out if you\u2019re vegetarian or vegan, you\u2019ll loose that smoky depth. I added the option to toss a big pinch of smoked paprika into the pot in its place in order to mimic the effect. <br> \u2013 <br>Sheela<br>,<br> April 2018<br> ",

        "How To Cook a Whole Chicken in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> The slow cooker strikes again! With minimal work and just one ingredient (psst \u2026 it\u2019s chicken) this recipe delivers the most delicious payoff imaginable \u2014 meat so tender and juicy it practically falls right off the bone. And it\u2019s all thanks to the small, closed environment of the slow cooker. <br> The real beauty of this recipe (yes, maybe even better than hands-off cooking!) is the ingredient list, as it contains a single item: one whole chicken. Okay, you might find salt and pepper on there too, but I like to assume those are givens in just about every recipe. And really, if you prefer to omit them, that\u2019s fine. The result will amaze you either way. <br> To be honest, I\u2019m usually a little dubious of recipes that call for just one ingredient \u2014 with barely any input, it\u2019s hard to expect a decent output \u2014 but I\u2019m happy to tell you that this chicken proves that belief totally wrong. It\u2019s one of the rare times just a little bit of work leaves you with a huge reward. <br> There\u2019s one important step to keep in mind before adding the chicken to the slow cooker. You want to create a base for the chicken to rest on so that it\u2019s not sitting directly on the bowl. This could be a small metal rack or trivet (like the one that came with your <br>electric pressure cooker<br>) or even three to four balls of aluminum foil \u2014 just enough so the chicken is raised about an inch off the bottom. <br> As the chicken cooks, it releases a fair amount of liquid, more so than roasting in the oven. Raising the chicken prevents it from sitting in a pool of liquid for an extended period of time and also encourages more air flow around the whole bird. <br> If you\u2019ve got a few potatoes, carrots, or onions hanging around, go ahead and use them as a base. Over the year, sweet potatoes have become a real favorite. <br> <br>More on This Tip:<br> <br>The Secret to Making Great Roast Chicken in the Slow Cooker<br> <br> While the moist environment in the slow cooker makes for seriously juicy chicken, it does have one potential drawback: Cooking a whole chicken in the slow cooker won\u2019t give you the browned, crispy skin you\u2019d get from roasting in the oven. If you\u2019re not a skin person, then this will hardly matter to you, but if a bird wrapped in a crisp, crackly skin is what you\u2019re after, there\u2019s a simple fix for that. <br> After the chicken has finished cooking in the slow cooker, transfer it to a baking sheet or dish and pop it under the broiler for about three minutes. It\u2019s just enough time to transform the skin, without heating up your kitchen. Since the chicken is so tender, it can feel tough to move it out of the slow cooker, but it\u2019s easier than it seems. I\u2019ve found that the best way is carefully lifting it using two metal spatulas (<br>fish spatulas<br> are especially handy). <br> At the end of cooking, you\u2019ll notice a good deal of liquid from the chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker. This stuff is like liquid gold, bearing a more intense and richer flavor than chicken broth. Either way, you\u2019ll want to save and <br>use it<br> just as you would chicken stock or broth. Keep it in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a few days; otherwise stash it away in the freezer until you\u2019re ready to use it. ",

        "How To Make Mac and Cheese in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> This slow cooker mac and cheese is so easy that it feels like it can\u2019t possibly be right. Dry pasta, milk, and cheese go in, and a few hours later you\u2019re scooping warm macaroni and cheese onto your plate. <br> Ready for a little magic in your dinner? Let\u2019s take a look at how this macaroni and cheese can be yours. <br> This recipe makes a casserole-style macaroni and cheese with a sturdy (but still creamy!) texture that can be sliced into squares. If you\u2019re looking for a macaroni and cheese with a looser texture that\u2019s more spoonable, then I\u2019d recommend sticking to either our <br>stovetop macaroni and cheese<br> or our <br>classic baked macaroni and cheese<br>. <br> Pasta, as wonderful as it is, just isn\u2019t an ingredient that can stand up to all-day cooking, so I\u2019m sorry to say that this is not the best recipe to make while you\u2019re away at work. However, it is a fantastic recipe to make if you need to get dinner going, but need to run a few errands outside the house, pick up your kids, or head to class for a few hours. Dinner will be waiting when you get back home. <br> Given the various rates at which different pastas cook, making macaroni and cheese in the slow cooker can be a slightly tricky affair. Therefore, I think it\u2019s best to stick to regular elbow macaroni for this recipe. I\u2019ve found that this shape cooks consistently and still gives your dish the classic mac and cheese feel. <br> You can definitely substitute other shapes, but just be aware that you\u2019ll need to do a bit of recipe jiggering. The cooking times might be a little different and you may need slightly more or less liquid. <br> Instead of the b\u00e9chamel we make for a <br>classic mac and cheese<br>, this slow cooker version relies on heavy cream and cream cheese. Another bonus to this method? The pasta cooks in the milk, which is a <br>trick we often use<br> to make mac and cheese extra-creamy and luxurious. The sauce will start to curdle if cooked too long, so keep an eye on the dish as you near the end of the cooking time. <br> This macaroni and cheese will look milky, watery, and very un-cheesy right up until the last 30 minutes, but then the remaining liquid gets rapidly absorbed into the pasta and the casserole almost magically firms up. The pasta will seem soft and chewy before this happens, so waiting the extra half-hour involves some trust. <br> Every slow cooker is a little different, so the total cooking time will vary. The first time you make this recipe, plan on being home toward the end of cooking so you can keep an eye on things. Starting at the two-hour mark, check the casserole every 20 to 30 minutes. The mac and cheese is done once all the liquid has been absorbed and you see no more milk on the bottom of the pot. Be careful of overcooking, since the dish can go from creamy to overcooked fairly quickly. <br> Slow cooker mac and cheese has been a beloved recipe on Kitchn for a few years, but we saw many of you were not getting the consistently reliable results you expect from our recipes. So we went back into the kitchen and reworked the recipe to make it even better. <br> Start by slow cooking the noodles first in a combination of milk, heavy cream, and cream cheese. Heavy cream and cream cheese replace the evaporated milk from the original version, plumping the noodles and building a creamier sauce. <br> Cheese separates if it is cooked too long, so instead of adding it at the beginning and tempting fate, wait until the noodles are tender. The heat of the slow cooker gently melts the shredded cheese when it\u2019s sprinkled on top at the end of cooking. Stir just before serving for a rich and cheesy sauce. Add a tad more salt, a pinch of ground red pepper, and dry mustard powder to boost the savory cheese flavor of this classic side dish. <br> This mac and cheese does double duty, pleasing both camps of mac and cheese lovers. Served right away, the result is creamy and scoopable (similar to a stovetop mac and cheese). But if you set the slow cooker to warm, the noodles soak up the sauce for a texture more akin to a baked, casserole-style mac and cheese. <br>\u2014 <br>Patty<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "Recipe: The Income Tax Cocktail",
        "<br> Yes, believe it or not, there really is a drink called the Income Tax cocktail. And what better day than April 17 to give this gin-based classic a try? <br> An old-timey concoction dating back to the late 1920s, the Income Tax cocktail is basically a <br>Bronx cocktail <br>(gin, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, and orange juice) with an added dash of <br>aromatic bitters<br>. <br> I did a little reading in the hopes of discovering a <br>colorful \u2014 if somewhat apocryphal \u2014 story<br> behind this drink\u2019s creation, but perhaps in keeping with the Income Tax\u2019s no-nonsense name, it was all just the (plain and unromantic) facts, ma\u2019am. <br> General consensus is, though, that the bitters are included in the recipe as a wink and a nod to the \u201cbitterness\u201d of tax season. After many bleary-eyed hours spent chasing after wayward slips of paper, and checking and rechecking digits and decimal points, I think many of us can relate to that. <br> In the many published recipes for this drink, ingredient proportions tend to vary widely. (Equal parts sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, and orange juice? Or dial back the two vermouths, and amp up the juice? A full shot of gin or just a little? Add one <br>dash<br> of bitters or two?) I experimented a bit and found my own personal favorite: heavy on the juice, light on the vermouth and bitters. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>How Much Is Actually in a Dash?<br> <br> The name of this cocktail makes me laugh, and also nod my head. Of all the days that require a cocktail, Tax Day has got to be at the top of the list. Whether you\u2019re scrambling to file on time, just discovering that you owe money, or want to celebrate a refund, this citrusy cocktail is the solution to all of those things. <br> I must confess, I\u2019m a former self-professed non-gin drinker, and mixing this cocktail was my first time making a drink that involved vermouth (in any form) or bitters. While I had an open mind, I half expected to wince after the first sip. But, that couldn\u2019t be further from what happened. This is a light, citrusy, well-rounded cocktail. It\u2019s perfect for Tax Day, and frankly any other day of the year. <br> This cocktail would also work well, and look quite pretty, with blood orange juice. <br> <br> \u2013 <br>Kelli<br>, April 2015 <br> ",

        "<br> As much as I love burritos and tacos, the thought of cooking and arranging all the elements separately \u2014 meat, rice, beans, and toppings \u2014 is sometimes more than I want to attempt on a busy weeknight. Not to mention the sheer number of dishes to tackle after the meal! <br> These burrito bowls have tender spiced rice, beans, corn, and BBQ-flavored chicken, all cooked together in a Dutch oven on top of the stove in just about 30 minutes. <br> Making everything in one pot and serving it as customizable burrito bowls is much more my speed. It\u2019s a quick way to get dinner on the table, but it still leaves you enough time to prep your favorite toppings while it cooks away, so that each dinner guest can customize their own dinner at the table. <br> The dish starts with classic Mexican rice, where rice is cooked in a blender sauce of tomatoes, chicken broth, onion, and garlic. Tender chunks of chicken coated in BBQ sauce cook right in the rice, and while most steamed rice recipes tell you to leave the rice alone, stirring it halfway through cooking ensures the grains all cook uniformly. <br> When the rice is done, top it with some frozen corn and a can of black beans, and let the whole thing sit for a few minutes to warm through and give the rice a chance to steam and fluff up a bit. Serve with some shredded lettuce and your favorite toppings, and put aside any leftovers to bring to work or school for a satisfying lunch. ",

        "Recipe: Mixed Mushroom Egg Bakes",
        "<br> Despite the fact we are entering one of my favorite, easy, and effortless breakfast seasons (fresh berries and yogurt, anyone?), I love any chance to work protein into my mornings, so I\u2019ve been doing a version of these egg bakes for some time now. They\u2019re perfect for a weekday meal because they hold up in the refrigerator for a good five days. When baked ahead of time, you can have a brunch-worthy breakfast on an average Wednesday, and it will feel like a pretty big treat. <br> I wrote about a version of these <br>egg bakes with ham and cheddar <br>a few years ago, and since that time have been making them with seasonal vegetables, mixing in cooked grains, and getting creative with spices, herbs, and cheese. Lately I\u2019ve really fallen for this simple mushroom, thyme, and mozzarella version, and I think you\u2019re going to like it too. <br> The ingredients here are pretty simple; you probably have half of them (or maybe more) on hand. The others won\u2019t cost a fortune to pick up. I use shallots because they\u2019re a bit more mild than onions, and slightly sweet, which works really well with the savory mushrooms and creamy egg and cheese mixture. <br> Try to find a nice combination of different mushrooms if you can: I used cremini and shiitake, but oyster mushrooms are also great. In general, I usually skip the standard white button mushrooms because I don\u2019t think their flavor is as complex. <br> The egg bakes are really as simple as cooking the shallots and mushrooms, mixing up a simple egg base with a little shredded cheese, seasoning the mixture, and popping them in the oven. <br> The egg bakes become domed and lightly browned on top \u2014 they\u2019re a real stunner when they come out of the oven. For this reason, I love making them for brunch or when we have friends over, as they look far fancier than the effort they truly take to make. As they sit, they\u2019ll settle just a bit, but will still taste delicious. They\u2019re a winning weekday recipe largely because they\u2019re so simple to make and have such a great shelf life \u2014 if you make them on a Sunday, you can reheat them throughout the week (I do so in the microwave). <br> As for other mix-ins or flavor options, Gruy\u00e8re is a great cheese alternative here and a handful of fresh corn in the summer is wonderful. I\u2019ve used roasted red peppers and feta cheese instead of the mushrooms and mozzarella, and I love doing a simple version with leftover roasted vegetables and Parmesan cheese. <br> Once you make them, you\u2019ll see how infinitely adaptable and simple they are and you can start scheming up a batch that will suit your tastes just perfectly.

        "<br> For our dinner party menu from Ina Garten\u2019s new book, <br>Make It Ahead<br>, we knew we needed a classic Ina dessert \u2014 something easy and relaxed, but totally showstopping. When we flipped to the page with this chocolate banana cake, we knew we\u2019d found it. <br> And when Faith talked to Ina, she also got an ingenious tip for not only making this cake ahead, but also making it even more moist a day later. <br> About this cake, Ina says, \u201cWhen we tested this recipe, we all couldn\u2019t stop eating it! The combination of banana, chocolate, and streusel is irresistible.\u201d Um, yes. <br> And a cake like this is the perfect choice for a dinner where you want to make everything ahead. Not only is it easily made ahead, but Ina let us in on a tip she learned while at her store, Barefoot Contessa. \u201cWhen you are making a pound cake or banana cake,\u201d she told Faith, \u201cif you wrap it well and refrigerate it it gets moister. It actually gets better!\u201d <br> So give it a try with this cake! Bake, cool, wrap, and refrigerate, then take out about an hour before dinner, and serve at room temperature with homemade whipped cream. <br> <br>Read more: <br>7 Essential Tips for Making (and Storing) Better Whipped Cream<br> <br> This was such a tasty, decadent way to eat banana bread! It stayed moist when stored in an airtight container and was delicious even days later. <br> To make the cake easier to remove from the pan, place a sheet of parchment paper like a sling into the bottom of the pan before greasing and flouring it. In Ina Garten\u2019s book, this cake was pictured baked in a metal pan, but I baked it in a ceramic baking dish. I think a metal pan would have helped the cake rise and bake a little more evenly, but ceramic is fine if it\u2019s all you have! If you bake it in a ceramic dish, add another 10 minutes or so to the baking time. <br> Mashing the bananas with a dinner fork was a fast, easy way to get them mashed up! <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, April 2015<br> <br> <br>\u2192 Buy the Book! <br>Make It Ahead: A Barefoot Contessa Cookbook<br> by Ina Garten<br> ",

        "<br> I have been fairly obsessed with cauliflower \u201crice\u201d ever since discovering it <br>earlier this year<br>. This finely chopped cauliflower is one of those cheater ingredients that actually tastes legit. No joke. <br> It has also brought Chinese fried rice, once relegated to the \u201ccomfort food\u201d category, squarely into my weeknight meal rotation. <br> This recipe is a pretty direct riff off of our ultimate <br>How To Make Fried Rice<br> from the stir-fry queen, Grace Young. The biggest difference here is that you need to cover the pan and let the cauliflower rice steam for a few minutes before the dish is ready to be served. I also usually throw some thick-cut bacon into my stir-fry (and use the bacon grease for cooking!), although you could really use any leftover bits of chicken or pork you may have \u2014 or keep it vegetarian and add <br>crispy pan-fried tofu<br> instead. <br> As a fried rice look-alike, this dish can hold its own. The cauliflower is chewy and nubbly in all the right rice-like ways. Bits of egg and tender vegetables also make it a satisfying meal on its own. This still feels like comfort food to me \u2014 just comfort food that\u2019s sneaking a few more vegetables into my day! ",

        "<br> I\u2019m convinced that if you take any vegetable, drizzle it with olive oil, sprinkle on salt and pepper, and throw it in the oven for 20 minutes, you\u2019ll get some of the best-tasting veggies ever \u2014 with little to no effort. One vegetable in particular takes to this treatment especially well: cauliflower. Whenever I make a batch of the stuff, it disappears without preamble. <br> Well, with this Meatless Monday recipe, that roasted cauliflower gets a major update. Because what do you do if you want that roasted cauliflower to be your <br>main dish<br> as opposed to just a side? Why, you serve it with rice, of course! And you take that glorious roasted cauliflower and quickly stir-fry it with some onions, garlic, chili, ginger, and scallions. <br> This roasted cauliflower stir-fry is actually a riff on a dish we used to order in restaurants all the time in Beijing. It was usually brought out to the table in a miniature wok with a candle underneath it to keep it warm and to crisp up the cauliflower as it sat on the table. This version gets you similar results, but roasting the cauliflower first makes the process much easier. <br> Spooned over a pile of steamed rice, it\u2019s a complete meal. Vegetarians will rejoice. (And so will die-hard carnivores). <br> For more recipes, amusing anecdotes, and a wellspring of advice on Chinese cooking methods and ingredients, check out <br>The Woks of Life<br>.

It\u2019s good, sure, but it\u2019s also never really had a \u201cwow\u201d moment for me. <br> Now, let me introduce you to this pad Thai. This dish has \u201cwow\u201d written all over it. It\u2019s tangy and savory in all the right places; it\u2019s crunchy and chewy and tender, all together. It has all the hallmarks of your favorite take-out pad Thai \u2014 except those spaghetti squash noodles are the star of the show. <br> I first started thinking about how I might make pad Thai out of spaghetti squash when I realized that squash noodles are actually much closer to <br>vermicelli and glass noodles<br> than they are to Italian pasta made with eggs. The cooked squash noodles are very thin and pliant, but they retain just a touch of crunch, which can sometimes be a bit jarring in a creamy pasta dish. In a noodle stir-fry, however, they\u2019re perfect. <br> Stir-fries like pad Thai have so much going on that the slight crunchiness of the squash noodles just goes into the mix. When you have chewy cubes of fried tofu, tender onions and scallions, crunchy peanuts, and a tasty sauce to bring it all together, who\u2019s going to notice whether the noodles are more brittle than usual? You lose some of the chewiness of rice noodles, but honestly, when the steaming plate was in front of me, I hardly noticed. <br> Let\u2019s talk about the sauce for this pad Thai for a second. Start with the proportions of tamarind paste, fish sauce, and palm sugar that I give here, but the first time you make it, you\u2019ll probably want to taste it and adjust it. The sauce should be stronger than you\u2019d want to eat on its own, but not so strong that it doesn\u2019t seem palatable anymore. I\u2019ve also found that some varieties of tamarind paste are stronger than others, and also that some people like their pad Thai more lightly sauced than others. This is just one of those things you have to try a few times and adjust until it\u2019s exactly to your liking. <br> If you have a wok, now is the time to use it. The high heat and the particular magic of wok-cooking gives the vegetables a nice crisp-tender texture and the whole dish a hint of smokiness. You can definitely cook it in a wider skillet, but there\u2019s something about the wok here that I think makes the dish extra special. <br> If you\u2019re wondering if you could just sub rice noodles in for the spaghetti squash in this recipe, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d If the end result is a dinner you look forward to eating and making, I say go for it, no matter what noodles you use.

        "Recipe: Spaghetti with Mascarpone, Meyer Lemon, Spinach, and Hazelnuts",
        "<br> We had two encounters with mascarpone cheese in pasta recently. One was seeing this <br>tagliatelle with spinach, mascarpone, and Parmesan<br> over on Jamie Oliver\u2019s website; the other was catching the tail end of a British cooking show where the host was making mascarpone-lemon spaghetti. (We\u2019re sensing an English theme.) <br> This is our version, which borrows a bit from both but has the bright flavor of Meyer lemon plus toasted hazelnuts, which turned out to be the best ingredient of all. <br> Mascarpone is a soft, scoopable, sweet cheese (not sugar sweet, but mild and milky with just the tiniest bit of tang). The Meyer lemon has that same quality: sweeter than a regular lemon but still tart. They make a great sauce together, lighter than a typical cream sauce but still silky and rich. <br> The hazelnuts were a last-minute addition. We made this pasta once without them, and we even tested a few bites with the nuts sprinkled on top before we dumped the whole lot into the pan. They really elevated this dish to something special, in our opinion, by adding another texture and flavor. <br> We didn\u2019t bother pre-cooking the spinach. Instead, we threw it in with the warm pasta and sauce, adding a tiny bit of pasta water to keep the mixture loose while we continued to heat it over a low flame. The spinach wilts in no time. In fact, the entire dish doesn\u2019t take more than 15 minutes to pull together. <br> The first time I made this dish was four years ago. I had friends from home visiting me in Italy for a bit and I was eager to greet them with a show-stopping meal. As spring was just on the cusp, I wanted to make something that felt fresh but was still comforting enough for the brisk days we were having in Northern Italy. This recipe sung to me, with its inclusion of hazelnuts, which were abundant where I was living. It ended up being such a success and a wonderful memory \u2014 of old friends with me for a moment in a foreign place sharing a celebratory meal. <br> Years later, this is a dish I still crave at this time of year. It\u2019s sophisticated yet wildly simple to make \u2014 the perfect choice for a dinner party or just a midweek meal that you want to feel a tiny bit more special. I encourage you to follow the recipe as is. Some may want to throw garlic in or add a dash of red pepper flakes, but try to let the ingredients here speak for themselves \u2014 they want to and will wow you. It\u2019s also very much worth seeking out a Meyer lemon here (Trader Joe\u2019s carries them!), as I do feel it makes a difference; the delicate floral, sweet notes that the citrus helps puts this dish on another level. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, April 2018<br> ",

        "<br> When we ran a series of make-ahead dinner party recipes from Ina Garten, we loved this colorful appetizer of stuffed peppers. The recipe also fits Ina\u2019s philosophy of making a dish ahead: Look for things that would be naturally made ahead and simply baked just before serving. <br> Ina says, \u201cRoasting brings out the sweetness in bell peppers. This is the kind of dish served at Spanish tapas bars \u2014 slices of red and yellow peppers are filled with garlic, green olives, golden raisins, spicy saffron, and bread crumbs. A nice glass of Spanish sherry would be delicious with it.\u201d <br> This was a great way to serve stuffed peppers as an appetizer instead of a main dish. The anchovies add some punch and saltiness that contrast nicely with the sweet roasted peppers. You can also make the filling a day ahead, just make sure to let it come to room temperature and stir it before using. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, April 2015<br> <br> <br>\u2192 Buy the Book! <br>Make It Ahead: A Barefoot Contessa Cookbook<br> by Ina Garten<br> ",

        "How To Make an Upside-Down Cake with Almost Any Fruit",
        "<br> Surely everyone is familiar with the classic pineapple upside-down cake, topped with rings of canned pineapple and dotted with neon-red maraschino cherries, all nestled in a brown sugar glaze? What many people don\u2019t know is that nearly <br>any<br> fruit can be subbed in for the pineapple-cherry combo with fresh, delicious results. Read on for our master recipe for making upside-down cakes with fresh fruits all year long! <br> Developed sometime around the turn of the last century, when canned pineapple was invented, the pineapple upside-down cake is a classic American cake that has probably passed the peak of its popularity. It\u2019s true that tastes have changed over the last 100 years and things like canned pineapple and maraschino cherries aren\u2019t considered as classy as they once were, but the upside-down cake, with its buttery brown sugar glaze balanced by the simple white cake below, still holds a lot of appeal. <br> These days, many people make the cake with pineapple, only they may use fresh fruit or leave off the day-glo maraschino cherries, which offers some improvement. I personally like the canned pineapple version enough, but really love it when fresh pineapple is used. However, my favorite way to reinvent this cake is to use fresh or frozen seasonal fruit, and if I\u2019m feeling really creative, some chopped fresh herbs. <br> This cake lends itself towards any fruit that cooks up well, which is any fruit you\u2019d make a pie with. In the pictures here, I used strawberries and rhubarb, but you can also use peaches, nectarines, fresh cherries, berries, apples, pears, bananas, mangos, apricots, or figs. Or any combination! I suppose you could even use citrus like oranges, grapefruit, and lemons, although I haven\u2019t tried it so I can\u2019t be certain. Plums are good if they\u2019re not too ripe and juicy. <br> Finely chopped herbs such as basil or lemon thyme are another more updated addition. Peaches and nectarines are great with basil and lemon thyme is delicious with just about anything. Mint would work with almost any fruit as well, and rosemary would be perfect with figs. Spices such as cinnamon would be good for the fall versions of this cake when fresh apples, persimmons, or pears would be a natural choice. <br> Fresh fruit is great, but frozen fruit works as well, so don\u2019t hesitate to use it. The only thing you want to be careful about is not using fruit that has been stored in juice or syrup. You want unsweetened, individual pieces \u2014 and be sure that they are still frozen when adding them to the topping before baking, as they are easier to handle that way. <br> This master recipe for upside-down cake uses less sugar than the classic recipe, which can have up to one cup of brown sugar and a whole stick of butter for the topping alone. I find that using less butter and sugar really allows the taste of the fruit to come through. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 you will still have a sticky, decadent topping! <br> Another classic method is to make the cake in a cast iron skillet. I don\u2019t recommend this method in this master recipe because most of our cast iron skillets have been heavily seasoned using savory foods like onions and garlic, and those flavors can sometimes transfer to the sweet cake. If you don\u2019t think this will be an issue, or if you have a skillet that is reserved for sweet dishes, then by all means use it. <br> The amount of prepared fruit needed for the topping is roughly two to three cups. The reason why this is a rough number is that fruit measures differently, depending on how it is cut. A cup of blueberries will be much different than a cup of sliced apples, for instance. What you want is at least a single layer of fruit covering the bottom of the pan, although you can let it pile up a little, too. It\u2019s good to really crowd the pan, as the fruit will shrink some when cooking. <br> The cake needs to be removed from the pan shortly after it has been taken from the oven or the fruit will stick. This can be a little tricky, as the fruit and brown sugar topping is still quite hot and can burn. I do this by placing the cake straight from the oven onto a cooling rack. As soon as the fruit has stopped bubbling (about one minute), I place a cake plate over the cake and, using hot pads, pick up the rack, cake, and cake plate. Holding all three firmly, in one motion I flip over to invert the cake. I set the whole stack down on the counter and remove the rack and then carefully remove the cake pan. There will be hot steam from the fruit, so use caution! This is an instance where a skillet is a good choice, as the handle makes it easy to remove. ",

        "Recipe: Two-Minute Creamy Salad Dressing",
        "<br> Sometimes a <br>basic vinaigrette<br> just won\u2019t do. Sometimes we need a velvety, creamy dressing drizzled on our greens. And yet ranch dressing can sometimes feel a little \u2026 salad-bar-at-the-steakhouse? Occasionally, yes, I love it. But this dressing, well, this has a little more <br>ooh-la-la <br>in its favor<br>.<br> And it\u2019s so, so easy. <br> The key to this dressing is a generous dollop of mayonnaise, which gives it body and creaminess. But unlike ranch dressing, which usually calls for buttermilk and a host of herbs and spices, I keep this dressing simple \u2014 just add a little Dijon mustard and a nice, tangy Champagne vinegar. <br> It\u2019s complex and lovely, perfect for dressing a simple plate of greens, like our favorite<br> side salad<br>, or for using as a dip for a party platter of veggies.

        "Recipe: Chickpea Nuggets",
        "<br> Getting kids to try new foods is simply an exercise in marketing. Case in point: When I made <br>falafel<br> for dinner one night, I called them chickpea nuggets instead of falafel and my children gobbled them right up. They asked for chickpea nuggets again and it got my mind churning with an idea for an actual chickpea nugget recipe \u2014 one with all the flavors and textures of chicken nuggets, but baked and egg-free. <br> These chickpea nuggets look like chicken nuggets, but are vegan and require only six pantry staples. And they\u2019re totally delicious! <br> Two pantry staples are responsible for turning a humble can of chickpeas into nuggets: rolled oats and the liquid from the chickpeas themselves (aka<br> aquafaba<br>). Grinding the oats into flour makes them almost undetectable in the nuggets, but their addition makes these nuggets a complete protein and more filling. The chickpea liquid acts as a replacement for eggs, which would typically hold this type of nugget alternative together. <br> Toasting the panko breadcrumbs before coating the nuggets gives the chickpea nuggets a richer hue, but also adds flavor and loads of crunchy texture. This single step gives the illusion of chicken nuggets instead of chickpea nuggets. <br> While this recipe may have come to fruition for my children, I admit that these tasty nuggets were enjoyed by adults as well. You can easily enjoy them as you might a falafel (wrapped in pita and drizzled with yogurt), on top of a salad, or like the classic kid food we love, with plenty of ketchup for dipping. ",

        "How To Make Banana Bread",
        "<br> I firmly believe that banana bread is something you should be able to make anytime and anywhere, with a mixer or with a fork, in a loaf pan or in a muffin tin \u2014 whenever you have a few bananas going soft and freckly. Banana bread, I\u2019m pretty sure, is at least 50 percent of the reason bananas exist. <br> Here is a very basic and very forgiving recipe that takes all of 10 minutes to whisk together. An hour of waiting while your house fills with tempting aromas and then you\u2019ll be snacking on your very own slice of warm, fresh-baked banana bread. <br> Just about the only requirement for making banana bread is that you use ripe bananas. Once the skins start to develop freckles and the fruits are just a little too soft for pleasurable snacking, then it\u2019s banana bread time. Letting your bananas ripen even longer \u2014 until the skins are brown and the fruit falls apart when you peel it \u2014 will make your bread even more strongly banana-flavored and richer. <br> Let\u2019s also talk for a second about mashing. Personally, I like to leave some banana chunks in my bread and I also like the one-bowl simplicity of mashing the bananas directly into the batter. If you are anti-chunk and like your bananas to be completely smooth, I recommend mashing them into a pulp in a separate bowl and then mixing them into the batter. <br> With a very few variations, the recipe I give below is universal to almost every church or community cookbook written in the last 50 years. It\u2019s definitely time-tested! It uses ingredients most commonly found in our pantries: white all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, butter, eggs, milk, and baking soda. <br> But when I say this is a forgiving recipe, I mean it. You can swap up to half the flour for whole wheat or another favorite whole-grain flour. You can use brown sugar instead of white (which makes a denser, moister bread) or another sugar altogether. You can use margarine or oil for the butter and almond milk, kefir, buttermilk, or even water for the liquid. The bread will be fine with just one egg. I\u2019ve never tested it without eggs, but I suspect this would still make a perfectly snackable loaf. <br> My point here is that you can still make banana bread even if you find yourself short on one of the other ingredients (except the baking soda \u2014 you need that!). You can also get creative and play with these base ingredients to your heart\u2019s content. <br> If it weren\u2019t already clear by this point, the implied subtitle of this recipe is \u201cdon\u2019t fuss; make it easy.\u201d If you find it easier to make a recipe like this in a stand mixer or with a hand mixer, then that\u2019s the method you should use. Personally, I prefer to make it by hand in a bowl the way my mother taught me \u2014 that feels somehow easier to me even though the same number of bowls get dirtied. <br> If you use a mixer, you have two options: you can melt the butter as directed and follow the recipe exactly, or you can leave the butter softened and cream it with the sugar. Creaming the softened butter and sugar will make your banana bread lighter and more cake-like with a finer texture; melted butter makes the bread denser and less crumbly. <br> How do you make your banana bread? Is your recipe similar to this one? Do you follow a different technique? And the most important question: chocolate chips, nuts, or plain? ",

        "Slow Cooker Recipe: Cheesy Panade with Swiss Chard, Beans & Sausage",
        "<br> A panade is one of those dishes that is way better than it has any right to be \u2014 or than it looks to be. It\u2019s an assembly of day-old bread, shredded cheese, and handy pantry ingredients (in this case, white beans, Swiss chard, and sausage) that gets doused with broth and baked until bubbly, like a savory bread pudding meets French onion soup. Not quite a soup and not quite a casserole, it\u2019s something more: the best of both worlds. <br> The only real drawback to panades, in my opinion, is that they take so long to bake that I\u2019m always starving by the time it\u2019s ready. This is where my friend the slow cooker comes in. <br> I make all the main ingredients the night before \u2014 toasting the bread, cooking the filling, even shredding the cheese \u2014 and then assemble everything the next day in the slow cooker. I think the panade is best when cooked for six hours on the HIGH setting, but cutting it back to four hours or slowing it down for eight hours on LOW is also OK. Just don\u2019t go beyond eight hours or the panade can burn. <br> Be forewarned: This recipe make a lot. It\u2019s perfect for feeding a crowd or making a week\u2019s worth of meals ahead of time. It also freezes surprisingly well, although it looks even more rustic once reheated! I recommend freezing in individual containers and reheating in a bowl in the microwave. <br> If you\u2019re wondering what exactly this dish is, think of it as a French bread stew that\u2019s a tiny bit brothy like French onion soup. (This is not the other version of panade, which is soaked bread used to keep meatballs or meatloaf moist.) We\u2019ve updated the recipe to use less broth so the finished panade is not soggy. Toasting or drying out the bread first is essential here because it\u2019s cooked in a slow cooker. Skipping this step will result in a thick, gloppy stew, but I\u2019ve offered two options so that you can pick the method for drying the bread that works best for you. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Christine<br>,<br> September 2017 <br> <br>Serves 6 to 8 as a main dish, or 8 to 10 as a side dish<br> <br>  <br>   1 (1-pound) loaf day-old crusty country bread, cut into 1-inch cubes<br>  <br> <br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 8 ounces uncooked pork sausage, casings removed<br> 1 medium yellow onion, diced<br> 1 medium bunch Swiss chard (about 12 ounces)<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 teaspoon dried thyme, or 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves<br> 2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans (3 cups beans), drained and rinsed<br> 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (8 ounces), divided<br> 4 cups (32 ounces) low-sodium chicken broth<br> Coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves (optional) <br> Dry out or toast the bread cubes. To dry out, place bread on a rimmed baking sheet and let sit out to dry at room temperature, stirring once or twice, at least 8 hours or overnight. To toast, place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a 375\u00b0F oven until toasted, stirring halfway through, about 20 minutes total. <br> Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sausage and onion and cook, breaking up the sausage into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the sausage is cooked through and the onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, chop the chard stems into 1/2-inch pieces, thinly slice the chard leaves, and keep the stems and leaves separate. <br> Add the chard stems to the pan and cook until the stems are softened, 3 to 5 minutes more. Add the chard leaves, garlic, and thyme, and cook until the leaves are wilted and tender, about 4 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. <br> Place 1/3 of the bread cubes (about 4 cups) in an even layer in a 6-quart or larger slow cooker. Scatter 1/3 of the chard mixture (about 1 cup) and 1 cup of the beans over the bread. Scatter 2/3 cup of the cheese over the entire layer. Repeat with layering in this order in the same amounts: bread, chard mixture, cheese, remaining bread, and remaining chard mixture. Refrigerate the remaining 2/3 cup of cheese. Pour the broth evenly over the top of the panade. <br> Cover and cook on the HIGH setting for 4 to 6 hours, or on the LOW setting for 8 hours. Sprinkle the reserved 2/3 cup cheese over the top of the panade in the last 15 minutes of cooking. Serve in bowls, garnished with parsley if desired. <br> <br>Make ahead: <br>The sausage and chard mixture can be cooked up to 1 day ahead, cooled, and refrigerated until ready to assemble. The bread can be dried or toasted up to 1 day ahead. <br> <br>Storage: <br>Freeze leftover panade in individual containers. Reheat in the microwave on HIGH for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring once or twice during cooking. <br> <br>Oven directions:<br> Assemble the panade in a 9\u00d713-inch casserole dish or Dutch oven. Cover with aluminum foil or a lid, and bake at 350\u00b0F for 45 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with cheese, and continue baking uncovered for 15 minutes more. ",

        "<br> A few years back we shared a make-ahead dinner party menu from Ina Garten, and in <br>our chat with her<br>, she talked about how simple a make-ahead menu can be \u2014 it\u2019s all in choosing recipes that are just as good made ahead. And when it comes to a dish that exemplifies that, soup is king. <br> Here\u2019s a delicious soup we chose as a first course. It\u2019s hearty and filling even with no meat, and Ina has a few extra tips for ways to finish it off in a special way. <br> In her own notes about this recipe, Ina explains, \u201cPearled farro is a whole grain that is now available in most grocery and health food stores. This soup with mushrooms, pancetta, and lots of vegetables is really hearty. I make it ahead, refrigerate it, and then reheat it, serving it with a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a swirl of Marsala wine.\u201d <br> Obviously this does have pancetta, but that can be left out at little cost to the soup. There\u2019s plenty of oil to cook the vegetables in. Substitute vegetable broth for the beef broth, and the soup is vegetarian. Leave off the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche at the end and it\u2019s vegan too. <br> This soup can simply be made ahead (and even frozen!) and reheated just before serving. If there\u2019s a little extra time, though, Ina likes to add a special finishing touch, like a crouton or bread. \u201cAs the flavor melds soup gets better, but I always try and put something with it,\u201d she told me. \u201cTake a baguette and do big long diagonal slices \u2014 then grill it in the panini machine brushed with olive oil. You can do a lot at one time, and then you have something crunchy with the soup.\u201d <br> Yum! Thanks, Ina! <br> This soup was rich and satisfying, and reminded me of a hearty cream of mushroom soup with all the farro, vegetables, and pancetta. Definitely great for dinner with some crusty bread or a green salad! <br> My package of farro wasn\u2019t specifically labeled \u201cpearled,\u201d but it did have a suggested cooking time of 45 minutes, which is the same as this recipe, so it ended up working just fine. If you can\u2019t find cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, use sour cream instead. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, April 2015<br> ",

        "Recipe: Parmesan Risotto with Roasted Shrimp",
        "<br> This creamy risotto, spiked with salty Parmesan and topped with sweet, juicy roasted shrimp, has a lot going for it. There\u2019s the slight edge of fancy<br>, <br>as risotto is something many of us eat at restaurants but not at home. And yet it\u2019s so comforting \u2014 a simple homestyle dish, really. It\u2019s also not difficult. <br> One of the nicest things about risotto is even if you turn one out that\u2019s not quite technically perfect in the classical sense \u2014 rice a little too soft, sauce not creamy enough, the dish a bit dry \u2014 it\u2019s still a <br>really<br> good meal. <br> Whether you\u2019re cooking with your someone special, for a group of friends, or for your whole family, here\u2019s a recipe that lends itself to some togetherness in the kitchen \u2014 easy risotto, stirred meditatively, cooked slowly, with a glass of wine in one hand and the music turned up. <br> If this is the first time you\u2019ve made risotto and you want a little extra guidance, check out our tutorial on making a basic risotto. This recipe is based on it closely. <br> <br>Learn how: <br>How To Make Risotto at Home<br> <br> I top this basic risotto with roasted shrimp, which is a lovely and easy way to incorporate shrimp into a dish. Just throw it into the oven as the risotto finishes cooking. Here I used tail-on shrimp, for some restaurant-style flair, but you could use any large uncooked shrimp. <br> The recipe makes a generous quantity of risotto \u2014 about six large portions. For two people, you could cut the recipe in half, or just enjoy leftovers for a couple of days. I like to reheat risotto on the stove with a bit of extra broth to help it loosen up, or you can shape the leftover risotto into patties and fry them in a skillet. <br> What\u2019s not to love about sweet, tender roasted shrimp piled on top of cheesy, extra-creamy risotto? This dish is simple yet special, and really the perfect pick for your next date night in or dinner party with friends. The recipe can easily be halved if you\u2019re cooking it for the former. <br> I also highly suggest popping opening a bottle of white wine to enjoy with this \u2014 use a bit for the recipe and then pour a glass for yourself as you cook! A crisp Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc would be especially nice here. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, April 2018<br> ",

Or, caramelize some figs in brown butter, crisp up some prosciutto, and toss the pasta in the whole delicious mix and you\u2019ve got something seriously fancy and impressive. Oh, and it doesn\u2019t take any more time to make. <br> This is the kind of pasta dish I want to serve to friends, family, or honestly anyone I can pull from the street and get to sit down at my table. It\u2019s luxurious, surprising, and comforting all at the same time. <br> While the ravioli cooks, melt butter in a skillet, add rosemary and quarters of fresh figs, and let everything cook until the butter <br>becomes golden-brown<br> and it smells fragrant. Toss the pasta with this sweet and nutty sauce, finish it with salty bits of crispy prosciutto just for good measure, and you\u2019ve got a dinner that\u2019s ready to wow. ",

        "How To Make Risotto at Home",
        "<br> The best risotto is rich and creamy, with supple grains of rice, perfumed of wine and Parmesan, and replete with butter. It is the kind of dish best served in a deep bowl with a large spoon for bite after bite of creamy comfort. <br> Risotto is a dish that is often associated with fancy high-end restaurants, but really, it\u2019s the epitome of Italian <br>home cooking<br> and comfort food. Knowing how to make a good risotto is something we think every cook should have in their back pocket, if only because it\u2019s one of those dishes that\u2019s so satisfying and easy to prepare, and it never fails to impress. <br> Risotto also has a reputation for being fussy and time-consuming. It\u2019s true that once you start cooking, it does require a fair amount of attention, but it doesn\u2019t take more than 30 minutes to make. In fact, true Italian cooks will tell you that risotto should take no more than 18 to 19 minutes from start to finish. One of our chefs in culinary school made us time him, and sure enough, his risotto was done in exactly 18 1/2 minutes every single time! <br> Risotto is more of a technique than a dish. Once you get a feel for the basic steps of making the soffrito, toasting the rice, and adding in the broth a scoop at a time, a whole world of dishes opens up. You can add caramelized onions, ribbons of swiss chard, bits of sausage, wild mushrooms from the farmers market, or any other combination of flavors and textures that suit your fancy. <br> <br>Use the best rice you can find. <br>Arborio is the most common of risotto rice and readily available at most markets, making for a fine starter risotto. But carnaroli rice is our favorite for texture and reliability \u2014 it\u2019s harder to overcook than arborio and can be found in plenty of specialty markets. Lastly, vialone nano rice is worth mentioning for its pure silkiness in finished risotto, but you may have to special order it. <br> <br>Read more: <br>Why I Only Use Carnaroli Rice to Make Risotto<br> <br> <br>Have everything ready before you step up to the stove. <br>This one thing is crucial for a good risotto: Measure, chop, and ready the rice, the wine, your add-ins, <br>and<br> the bowls to serve it in. Risotto waits for no one and is perfect the second it\u2019s done. <br> <br>Warm your broth.<br> This is the secret to faster, creamier risotto at home: Pour your broth into a saucepan and warm it over medium heat. Warming the broth before adding it to the warm rice coaxes more starch out of each grain and prevents overcooking. Cool broth takes longer to warm up in the risotto pan and may shock the grain into holding onto its starches while the rice itself continues to cook. <br> The best way to determine risotto doneness is with both your eyes and your mouth. First take a look at the pan: Is the risotto creamy but not thick, rolling back after the spoon is run through the pan? You\u2019re probably very close to done. Now take a bite \u2014 the rice should be mostly soft with <br>a small bite on the softer side of al dente<br>. <br> Just before serving, add a few more dabs of butter and the Parmesan and then serve the risotto swiftly in warm bowls. <br> <br>This post has been updated \u2013 originally published March 2012 <br> <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

This gradual addition of liquid is key to getting the rice to release its starch and create its own delicious sauce, so don't rush this step.

        "How To Make the Best Flourless Chocolate Cake",
        "<br> If you\u2019ve got some great chocolate in the pantry and some eggs in the fridge, get your whisk ready, because this flourless chocolate cake recipe does it all. Rich and indulgent, it\u2019s been a classic way to end many a restaurant dinner for generations. <br> But this air-lightened, egg-whitened flourless chocolate cake is also a deceptively easy dessert that solves dinner conundrums and suits nearly everyone. <br> Designed without even a pinch of flour, this cake serves two purposes (aside from being swoon-worthy), and the first is in the service of chocolate. <br> Sans flour, the chocolate flavor is expansive and has room to sing. The intense flavor of chocolate unencumbered by flour makes this cake paradoxically lighter and richer than most chocolate cakes. <br> More impressive is this cake\u2019s versatility. It is the answer for entertaining folks with different food lifestyles and needs. Believe it or not, not all \u201cflourless\u201d chocolate cakes are truly flour-free; some include a tablespoon or two of flour. Not this one. Need a dessert for Passover? Something gluten-free? Something without white flour? Here\u2019s the recipe for you. <br> Flourless chocolate cake (aka FCC) needs intense chocolate flavor and a balance of dense and light textures; and of course, you have to actually be able to make the darn thing work. <br> Here are the tricks you need in your toolbox for cake success: Top-of-the-line ingredients, a mad amount of egg whites, and a few techniques to get maximum volume and lift. <br> Cocoa powder is a rather mysterious baking ingredient for something used so often. Yes, it\u2019s a dry ingredient, but it\u2019s not quite flour, not quite starch, and not quite chocolate. It is what it is: dried roasted cocoa bean powder. Even in this recipe it is not a flour substitute. It does absorb some moisture, but it\u2019s mostly here for the flavor. It adds an underlying bitterness that defines the ferociously addictive taste of chocolate and highlights the sweetness of sugar. <br> Here are three pieces of advice for choosing the best cocoa powder for your cake. <br> Whipping egg whites gives baked goods lightness. You can quickly and easily <br>whip eggs<br> in a stand mixer. And yes, you can also do it with a handheld electric mixer or by hand using a wire whisk with some zumpf. As you whip the egg whites, they will go through several stages; this recipe calls for whipping until you form \u201cstiff peaks\u201d to take advantage of every inch of height and lift those egg whites can offer. It keeps the cake airy. <br> <br>Want to see it done?:<br> <br>A Visual Guide to Whipping Egg Whites<br> <br> Although it looks like there are lots of rules about egg white whipping and folding (and there are), take comfort in knowing that the worst thing that can happen if you don\u2019t do the egg whites exactly right in this recipe is that the cake will be a little less light. Dense chocolate? Rename it fudge cake and serve it with pride. In fact, I can\u2019t think of a better recipe to learn on. <br> A chilled cake is easier to cut but room temperature lets the aromas and texture loose. If it\u2019s a picture-perfect slice you\u2019re after, slice the cake while it\u2019s lightly chilled. Regardless of temperature, cut the cake with a thin long knife that is dipped into warm water before each slice and wiped down before slicing again. ",

Bake until the cake has risen ever-so-slightly in the center and is set enough in the center that it will not jiggle when the pan moves; a cake tester will not come out clean, 34 to 37 minutes. The top will have formed an extremely thin, but discernible, crust. The cake will pull away from the side of the pan while it cools; don't let it bake until it pulls away from the side of the pan while in the oven or it will be overdone.

        "Recipe: Easy Ricotta Gnocchi",
        "<br> A traditional Florentine pasta, ricotta gnocchi is the lighter, hipper cousin to northern Italy\u2019s potato gnocchi. This gnocchi cooks up as soft, mild-flavored dumplings. They make a great base for any sauce, whether it\u2019s <br>brown butter<br> or a simple tomato sauce. And if we\u2019d known how easy it was to make ricotta gnocchi, we would have added it to our cooking rotation years ago! <br> The gnocchi should be served as soon as they\u2019re cooked, so be sure to have the sauce ready. We like to prep the ingredients for both the sauce and the dough at the same time, make the dough, and then prepare the sauce while the dough is resting. <br> Refrigerating the gnocchi for 15 minutes firms up the dough and makes it easier to work with. <br> Gnocchi freezes very well and will keep for one month. (After that, they\u2019re still safe to eat, but the \u201cfresh\u201d quality diminishes.) Spread the extra gnocchi out on a sheet pan and place in the freezer until the gnocchi are firm. Transfer to a freezer bag or container. Frozen gnocchi can be put directly into boiling water to cook. <br> Ricotta gnocchi is potato gnocchi\u2019s lighter, fluffier, easier-to-make cousin, which is exactly why you should give it a try immediately. I started making this type of gnocchi as a way to use up good ricotta I\u2019d buy from my local Italian store (otherwise I\u2019d just eat it with a spoon since it\u2019s my most favorite of all cheeses). Now I make it whenever I am craving puffy little pillows of cheesy goodness that are as versatile \u2014 try them with brown butter, pesto, or the most simple <br>marinara sauce<br> \u2014 as they are comforting. <br> A word of advice: While ricotta gnocchi is less finicky to make than <br>potato gnocchi<br> (since there is less risk of overworking the dough and getting tough, gummy results), it\u2019s still wise to follow directions. I\u2019ve made many batches of ricotta gnocchi that end up falling apart as soon as they hit the pot of boiling water. <br> The secret is to drain the cheese for longer than you think \u2014 overnight really is best \u2014 and if you do cook them from frozen, cook them in small batches so that the cold dumplings don\u2019t lower the water temperature too much, which can cause things to turn to mush. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, April 2018<br> ",

As long as you have some <br>shredded coconut<br> stashed away in your cupboard and a few eggs that you don\u2019t mind cracking, a batch of sweet macaroons can be yours in less than half an hour. <br> The proper color for a macaroon is a matter of great controversy and personal taste. Snowy-white or toasted golden? As you can see by these pictures, I am a sucker for a well-toasted macaroon. I like to toast the coconut just slightly before even mixing it with the egg whites. Once baked, these turn a lovely golden color with a delicately crunchy shell and a deep coconut flavor. <br> If you prefer the classic white macaroons, skip the toasting step and keep an eye on your macaroons as they bake. At around 15 minutes, the tips will just be starting to turn golden, and that\u2019s probably when you\u2019ll want to pull them from the oven. <br> There are countless ways that you can tweak this basic macaroon recipe for your own tastes and whims. Add more coconut for lighter macaroons or whip your whites and sugar into a meringue for an even crunchier version. You can also tuck nuts or chocolate (or both!) inside your macaroons or fold dried fruit into the batter. And never underestimate the power of a little drizzled chocolate to take your macaroons up yet another notch. <br> <br> What are your favorite ways to make macaroons?<br> ",

        "<br> Roasted broccoli is a dinner staple in our household. It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to get some greens on our plates \u2014 especially on those nights when our dinner timeline is particularly tight. I can grab a bag or two of frozen broccoli and we can eat as we normally do, but with a fraction of the prep. <br> Since we eat it so regularly, I\u2019ve tried plenty of variations on roasted broccoli. To date, this sesame-ginger roasted broccoli is my family\u2019s favorite. Loaded with flavor, it\u2019s still versatile enough to serve alongside almost any meal. <br> I\u2019m a big believer in generously salting roasted broccoli, and in this case the vegetables get both saltiness and umami flavor from soy sauce instead. My favorite part is the zesty addition of ginger \u2014 fresh or frozen. I keep a couple hands of ginger in the freezer to avoid using just a small piece and letting the rest go bad. Plus, I find frozen ginger easier to chop than fresh. <br> Finally, the roasted broccoli gets a generous garnish of toasted sesame seeds.

        "How To Make Classic Buttermilk Biscuits",
        "<br> Classic buttermilk biscuits are a staple in my household. Quick, easy, and light as a feather, they can be served for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and even dessert! The technique is simple (hint: freeze the butter and use a light touch) but the results are spectacular. <br> I\u2019ve been making these buttermilk biscuits for over 20 years now. They\u2019re so much a part of who I am that I can almost go all grandma-style and make them without measuring! On several occasions, I\u2019ve multiplied the recipe x10 to serve to 60 people for breakfast. They\u2019re based on a recipe from <br>Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant<br> but really, most buttermilk biscuit recipes are very similar. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the various elements of buttermilk biscuits. <br> I use all-purpose flour for my biscuits, although lately I\u2019ve liked the flavor and texture of substituting 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of white. The butter is always unsalted \u2014 if you do use salted butter, be sure to eliminate the salt in the dry ingredients. If you want to make these biscuits and there\u2019s no buttermilk on hand, don\u2019t despair. I\u2019ve had excellent results thinning plain yogurt with milk until it reaches buttermilk consistency. <br> I\u2019ve been <br>measuring my ingredients using a scale<br> these days, so I\u2019ve given that option here for the butter and flour. <br> One of the most important tricks to making fantastic biscuits is for the butter to be super cold. I always start this recipe by cutting up my butter and placing it in the freezer. Even just 5 minutes in the freezer will give it that extra chill. <br> I have found, though, that completely frozen butter is a little hard to work with, especially if you are mixing by hand. Those nuggets of butter just want to stay in hard lumps and won\u2019t cut in without a lot more work. If your butter is completely frozen, you might try grating it on a cheese grater. <br> A very hot oven is also key to good biscuits. My oven tends to run hot, so I put the temperature at 425\u00b0F, but if your oven is cool, you can go up to 450\u00b0F. <br> The recipe below gives instructions for making the dough in a food processor, but don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have one. They can easily be made in a bowl the old-fashioned way (see recipe notes.) I use the processor because it\u2019s the best way to blend the butter and buttermilk into the dry ingredients without overmixing. But I\u2019ve also made this recipe dozens of times without the machine, so it\u2019s not a requirement. <br> The one thing that\u2019s even more important than temperature when making biscuits is to not overwork the dough. You do not want to create a cohesive dough in the food processor \u2014 it should look like rough gravel when you tip it out onto the floured counter. When you bring it together into a rectangle, use a light touch and go quickly, gently pressing and gathering the gravel into a mass. The movement is more like patting and less like kneading. <br> The recipe calls for cutting the dough into thirds and restacking it, pressing gently to bring everything together. This is to help encourage flaky layers in the biscuits. Again, you don\u2019t want to overwork the dough: just cut, stack, press gently and quickly a few times with the heel of your hand and repeat. <br> When I roll out my dough, I only use a few quick strokes. Maybe six in all. Sometimes it is even possible to forgo the rolling and just pat the dough into a rectangle. <br> I like to make square biscuits because it means that I\u2019m handling the dough less and there are no scraps leftover. Of course you can make round biscuits but do not re-roll the scraps more than once or you will have tough biscuits. ",

        "How To Make Deviled Eggs",
        "<br> Deviled eggs are ingenious. They take hard-cooked eggs \u2014 already one of the world\u2019s most perfect foods \u2014 and elevate them into an elegant bite that\u2019s worthy of any appetizer plate. From summer picnics and Easter brunch, to afternoon <br>snack time<br> and Sunday supper, deviled eggs are more than up for the occasion. <br> Deviled eggs are also one of the easiest appetizers we know how to make. Today, we\u2019ll show you the easiest, most basic method for these irresistible treats, with plenty of ideas for making them your own. <br> Deviled eggs are a classic hard boiled egg preparation. The cooked yolks are combined with creamy flavorful ingredients like mayo and mustard and the whites are filled with this delightful, bright and velvety filling to make a one to two bite egg appetizer that is beloved for holidays. Deviled eggs also make a very good lunch, sort of like an egg salad sandwich without being quite so messy. Our method will give you the quintessential deviled egg, but if you\u2019re looking for other fun, fast and fancy interpretations we\u2019ve got a few more ideas below. <br> It all starts with hard-boiled eggs. Our favorite method is to cover the eggs with water, bring the water to a boil, and then let the eggs sit off the heat for about 10 minutes. This makes whites that are firm but still tender and yolks that are set but still creamy. If you need a refresher on this method, read more about it here: <br> <br>Everything You Need to Know About Hard-Boiled Eggs: <br> <br> Part of the eternal appeal of deviled eggs is their sheer simplicity. You don\u2019t need much to make a good deviled egg. Here we use just a generous spoonful of mayo and a dollop of mustard mixed into the yolks \u2014 that\u2019s all you really need! Mayo takes the already creamy yolk and makes it even creamier and more decadent, while the tangy yellow mustard tames the richness. <br> The only other tricky moment with deviled eggs is actually filling them. You can certainly use a spoon, but it\u2019s worth considering using a bag to pipe the filling. It\u2019s a lot neater and easier than it might seem. You don\u2019t even need a real piping bag \u2014 just scoop the filling into a plastic bag, squeeze the filling into a corner, and snip off the corner. Party-worthy deviled eggs, zero fuss. <br> The eggs can be hard-boiled and peeled up to 1 day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. You can also make the filling up to 1 day ahead, but store in a piping bag or in an airtight container with plastic wrap pressed onto the surface in the refrigerator. Fill the egg white shells when ready to serve. <br> Keep your deviled eggs simple or gussy them up with herbs and spices \u2014 just about any way you make deviled eggs, they\u2019re sure to be delicious. <br> Do you have a favorite way to make deviled eggs?

Roll each piece of dough into a long rope roughly 1-inch thick and 16 inches long, making sure that the ropes are of somewhat equal thickness from top to bottom. This is a very sticky dough, and adding too much flour will toughen the dough, so use the flour sparingly, and use a very lightly oil-sprayed bench scraper to assist you in picking up and moving the dough when you first start rolling each section of dough. As you roll the dough and work with it in your hands with some vigor, the dough will become tighter, come together, and be soft in your hand and still easy to roll. ",

Place the egg yolk and orange juice or water in a small bowl and whisk to combine to make an egg wash. Brush a liberal amount on the dough, making sure to coat the sides and in all of the cracks and around the dyed eggs. Let sit for 5 minutes, then brush another coating of egg wash to ensure a complete coating. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, avoiding the dyed eggs.",
            "Bake until the bread is a deep golden-brown and puffed, about 30 minutes. The center should register between 190\u00b0F and 200\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer.",
            "Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before using a flat spatula to transfer the bread to a cooling rack to cool completely."

        "<br> Is there a more beloved party food than a platter of freshly deviled eggs? The humble and classy appetizer gets sassed up when plunged into a jar of beets, vinegar, brown sugar, and pink peppercorns. This unique twist will turn heads and delight tummies! <br> As a kid, I feared the hard-boiled egg \u2014 the rubbery, lifeless, mealy, too-rich yolk turned me off. I eschewed the ubiquitous plate of party deviled eggs in search of finer snack foods, namely cheese doodles (if super lucky), but I\u2019d settle for crackers of any sort. Then I\u2019d sit on the couch and eat my way through a small stack, systematically whittling down my cracker by nibbling its circumference, enjoying the salty crumbles over a 15-minute period, washing down my forbidden processed glory with a glass of lemonade. <br> About 25 years later, I tried a deviled egg \u2014 what a delight I\u2019d been missing! Gone was the chalky, fatty taste, and hello to a piquant blend of mustard, onions, and pickle. It was party time with me and the eggs, and it was on! <br> These beet-soaked darlings are the only improvement or variation I\u2019d recommend over a classic, paprika-dusted standard. Normally, deviled eggs aren\u2019t going to win any beauty contests, but with the beet-brine bath, they take on a striking pink cloak as well as an earthy sour tang. The addition of peppercorns and brown sugar imbues another level of pickled spice. The filling punctuates the tang with the subtle curry spice and freshness of aromatic rosemary. <br> These eggs are not for the timid, but they are so lively and packed with flavor! Perfect on their own or smashed onto a piece of hearty toast, they make an excellent breakfast or anytime snack. That\u2019s to say you have leftovers, which you won\u2019t. So make an extra batch for yourself. ",

        "Recipe: Sweet Braided Czech Bread with Almonds & Raisins",
        "<br> Most Eastern European households have an Easter tradition of sweet eggy bread. This is my family\u2019s \u2014 an enormous braided loaf, scented with nutmeg and lemon, peppered with almonds and plump golden raisins. It originated on my maternal grandfather\u2019s Czech side of the family tree, and all my life I\u2019ve known it as <br>houska<br>. As in, \u201cUncle Ed is doing the houska this Easter.\u201d Or, \u201cI burned the top of the houska.\u201d \u201cTell me again, who\u2019s bringing the houska?\u201d It\u2019s a treasured Easter treat, the taste and scent of it mixed with holiday memories. <br> But you know what? My family has it all wrong. This bread isn\u2019t <br>houska<br> at all. We\u2019ve been using the wrong name for at least 70 years. Does it matter? <br> The first clue that my family legacy was suffering a misnomer appeared when I shared the recipe here seven years ago. A reader chimed in almost immediately: \u201cThis is not houska but VANOCKA, and baked specially on Christmas.\u201d I shrugged this off, as of course all foods enjoy diversity of names and language, and houska is houska. <br> But that reader wasn\u2019t alone; <br>SpicieFoodie<br> also added a speck of commentary: \u201cThis is not houska \u2014 houska is a small braided, savory bread roll. The bread you\u2019ve pictured here is called V\u00e1no\u010dka (vanocka). It is found and eaten year long but it\u2019s not an Easter bread but rather a traditional Christmas bread. The name [vanocka] comes from the Czech and Slovak words for Christmas.\u201d <br> Well. The idea that our treasured bread has been called by the wrong name all our lives was just too much, but when I came back here to update the recipe for a new Easter season, I knew I had to face up to the possibility. I inquired at the oracle of the wider internet, and the answer was unequivocal: <br>Houska<br> is a bread roll. <br>Vanocka<br> (vah-NOTCH-kah) is a Christmas bread, and what we eat at Easter. The same type of dough is also shaped into a round loaf at Easter and called <br>mazanec. <br> <br> I was crestfallen, I admit. The word <br>houska<br> carries for me a wealth of memories: sneaking bites of yeasty sweet dough, watching yellow raisins grow fat and juicy in hot water, hearing my mother and grandmother grouch over how dry (or underdone, or under-risen) their bread this year turned out to be. But it was always perfect and waiting on Easter morning, a reason to get out of bed early for a rich, dense slab of bread that under no circumstances needed more butter and yet always got a little pat, with a sprinkle of salt. The most transcendent toast involved <br>houska<br>; the fights over last scraps of bread happened only over <br>houska. <br> <br> Can I substitute the more correct word retroactively? A culinary cut-and-paste into the texture of childhood memory? I don\u2019t think so. This bread will always be <br>houska<br> to me, regardless of any mistakes of memory or translation my great-great-aunts and grandmothers made in their own translation from the Old World to Cleveland, Ohio. The word, the bread, the memories are all too tightly tied. <br> Do you have a story like this in your family? A dish or a legacy carried into the New World from the Old, perhaps, and passed like a game of telephone from one kitchen to another? I am not sure where the boundaries of authenticity line up in these handovers, or when a recipe begins to be ours and not only belong to our originating place. <br> I know too that I am not the only one whose family has carried the bread and not the name in a direct line. Down in the comments <br>sandy from nebraska<br> says, \u201cThis looks just like my grandmother\u2019s Christmas Houska, except she added candied fruit. I never heard it called Vanoka. She was 100% Czech \u2014 parents came from the old country.\u201d <br>Brenna_Kathleen<br> also has a houska-making grandmother: \u201cMy grandma makes a couple loaves of Christmas Houska every year with some green and red candied fruit. She also always puts anise in,\u201d she says. <br> But I hope you\u2019re not put off by the linguistic wrangling; this bread is glorious, no matter what you call it. I feel that in sharing it I share quite literally a piece of my family and the taste of Easter morning. It\u2019s so dense, soft, and a little flaky \u2014 not springy or airy. The braided construction makes for a spectacular holiday centerpiece, and its sweet buttery flavor will have everyone reaching for a second (and third, and fourth) slice. It may look complicated, but it\u2019s quite straightforward and the rich dough is forgiving. I included some step-by-step photos to show how it all comes together. <br> I am glad to know the correct word for this bread, and even to learn a few traditions that my family didn\u2019t pass down (did you know that you\u2019re supposed to jump up and down while the bread is rising, to make it light?). In in my reading I learned that others (like me!) carefully assemble their bread only to have it slump to one side in the oven. Every year the <br>houska <br>or <br>vanocka <br>turn out a little differently, which means that we get to tell a story that braids last Easter with this one (\u201cRemember how last year it was doughy in the middle?\u201d) <br> In the twists and turns of <br>vanocka <br>and <br>houska <br>I felt like I bumped against the place where family truth and culinary truth stretch, braid, and tense to accommodate one another. No matter what I call it (fine \u2014 I admit it will always be <br>houska<br>) I\u2019ll come back to this bread year after year to see, one more time, if I can make it stand up straight and keep the braids from slipping, and whether it will always be as delicious as my mother\u2019s.

        "How To Make Frozen Pizzas at Home",
        "<br> Frozen pizzas have their time and place, like when we need a backup meal when we don\u2019t have time to shop or an easy heat-and-serve dinner for babysitters. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a good store-bought frozen pizza in these situations, but making your own homemade frozen pizzas from scratch will probably save you some pennies \u2014 plus, you get exactly the toppings you want! <br> It\u2019s also easy to do. With just two little tricks you can fill your freezer with all the made-ahead frozen pizzas you could ever want. <br> Whenever I\u2019m planning a pizza night, I\u2019ll often prepare extra dough and toppings. A few pizzas get baked straight away for dinner and the rest get frozen for later meals. These pizzas are perfect for instances when I run out of time or motivation to make a full meal. If I know a particularly busy time is coming up, I\u2019ll make sure I have a good supply of pizzas along with my other freezer meals to see me through. <br> Frozen pizzas also make a great food gift to give new parents too busy to cook or students heading back to school. Smaller individual-sized pizzas are a good after-school snack for kids still living at home \u2014 older children can even heat their own pizzas. <br> Made ourselves with toppings that we get to choose, I see absolutely nothing wrong with having a few frozen pizzas in the freezer! <br> The first trick is to par-bake the crust, which sounds more complicated than it really is. Par-baking really just means you partially bake the crust before topping and freezing it. This ensures an extra-crisp crust and zero sogginess upon final baking. (P.S.: These par-baked crust can be frozen without toppings too, which is an ingenious way to prep for a personal pizza party.) <br> When the par-baked crusts are cooled, top them with your favorite toppings and then freeze them unwrapped on a baking sheet until solid, about three hours. This prevents the wrapping from clinging to the cheese and sauce and makes them easier to unwrap later. <br> The second trick is to wrap the par-baked and topped pizzas first in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. This double layer protects pizzas and their toppings from drying out in the freezer, which leads to freezer burn and a less-than-stellar pizza. Wrapped this way, pizzas can be kept frozen for up to three months. <br> When you\u2019re ready to bake your frozen pizza, crank the oven to 500\u00b0F and ready a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven for baking. Take the pizzas directly from the freezer, unwrap, and bake from frozen. ",

        "How To Make Hot Cross Buns",
        "<br> Hot cross buns are lightly sweetened, mildly spiced rolls with a distinct image of a cross that runs across the top. They are specifically associated with Good Friday, and have been for almost a millennium. Over time, hot cross buns in the U.S. became extremely sweet, and today are often criss-crossed with a sugary icing, but that isn\u2019t the recipe of yore; the original crossing mixture was more of a paste. <br> Classic hot cross buns hold genuine symbolic value that can stand deliciously and proudly alongside any holiday baked treat. <br> The buns were first made by monks in honor of Easter throughout the United Kingdom, Scotland, Ireland, and Britain. By the 16th century, they were so intertwined with Good Friday they appeared in verse: \u201cGood Friday comes this month, the old woman runs, with one or two a penny hot cross buns.\u201d Hot cross buns reign in the land of nursery rhymes and bakeries to this day. <br> The early version of the crossing mixture \u2014 still made this way in Europe to this day \u2014 is not difficult. This recipe embraces the European versions. It makes great-looking crosses that consistently hold their shape and taste delicious. You lightly score the buns to form the shape of a cross making straight lines, and then a luscious paste is piped into the grooves. <br> Hot cross bun history features many a tale of good luck for those making, eating, and even keeping these buns. Great friendships are said to be sealed over a shared bun, and baking and eating them atavistically protects you from getting the evil eye. The bun itself is said to last from year to year, and was allegedly made into bread pudding. For those without special ancient powers, hot cross buns last for about two days. ",

        "<br> You can have the turkey. Leave the ham. Prime rib \u2014 what\u2019s that? In my house, leg of lamb is the celebratory roast; I love its tenderness and flavor. And, of course, it\u2019s the high season for lamb right now, as lamb figures prominently on both the Passover and Easter tables. <br> Have you ever roasted a leg of lamb? It may sound intimidating, but the sweet little secret is that leg of lamb is actually one of the easiest, most foolproof cuts of meat to cook. Here\u2019s our remarkably simple, fuss-free approach to cooking a leg of lamb. It will turn out perfectly every time. <br> While I\u2019ve cooked lamb on many occasions, cooking a whole leg can still feel intimidating. It\u2019s a large, expensive cut of meat, and I always wonder whether I am going to dry it out or make it tough. Should I marinate it? Should I do something special to make sure it\u2019s cooked properly? <br> I spoke to my favorite local butcher, <br>Bluescreek Farm Meats<br>, in Columbus, Ohio, to learn a little more about leg of lamb and how to cook it. <br> Here are some expert tips from Jamie Smith at Bluescreek on what to look for in lamb, and how to cook it. A sneak peek: Cooking a leg of lamb is actually really, really simple. <br> When we talk about lamb leg, we mean one of the back haunches of the animal, and the most common cut includes the upper part of the leg only. (Think of the thigh, without the lower part of the leg.) <br> Usually leg of lamb is sold without the shank attached; you are just buying the upper part of the leg, as seen here, without the lower part. You can order a leg of lamb with the shank left on, however; this is sometimes called an \u201cAmerican leg,\u201d but usually it\u2019s simply referred to as \u201cshank-on leg.\u201d <br> Some people prefer this, as it looks more traditional and dramatic on a serving platter, but there\u2019s no major advantage to having the shank (other than getting an extra soup bone!). <br> Jamie prefers bone-in, for the flavor. Think of how we make stock from bones, she said. The bones hold so much of the flavor. When you roast a piece of meat with the bone still in, you are getting all that flavor in the meat itself. A bone-in lamb leg can be a little trickier to carve, but we opted for bone-in in this cooking lesson (we\u2019ll show you how to carve it). <br> If you are really nervous about carving meat, boneless is fine; it\u2019s easier to slice. If you buy a boneless leg of lamb, it will probably come in a net. When the bone is removed from the lamb, the meat needs to be held together in the shape of the leg for cooking, so heatproof, oven-safe netting is usually used. If your netting isn\u2019t oven-safe, you can tie it up with kitchen twine instead (or ask your butcher to do it for you!). <br> When buying a leg of lamb we recommend doing so from a <br>quality and reputable butcher<br>. A leg of lamb is expensive regardless of where you buy it, so we feel that the investment is best spent with a butcher who either raises the animals himself (as Bluescreek does on their farm) or who can tell you how the lambs were raised. <br> We look for lambs that are <br>market weight<br>, which means no baby lambs, and no lambs that are too old and verging on (tougher) mutton. <br> Also, ask the butcher if they can <br>trim the lamb<br> <br>leg <br>for you if they have not already done so. This means that they will trim away the fell, a thick outer layer of fat (which is what can make lamb taste so strongly \u201cmutton-y\u201d), as well as any additional fat that you request to have removed. Personally, I like a nice pad of fat, which insulates the meat and keeps it tender. <br> Now, how to cook your leg of lamb? Here\u2019s where things get really interesting. <br> \u201cLamb leg is a really tender cut,\u201d said Jamie at Bluescreek. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to marinate it.\u201d In fact, she said, marinating lamb can actually make it tougher. A marinade is designed to break down the tough fibers in meat, but since lamb is naturally so tender, marinating can destroy the integrity of the meat \u2014 the texture and flavor \u2014 and make it tough to chew. \u201cI would not marinate a lamb leg for more than two or three hours,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to follow a recipe, but be cautious.\u201d <br> To add flavor to the roast, we decided to skip marinating altogether and season it simply with herbs and garlic. <br> Personal preference should determine how long you cook your leg of lamb. Personally, I find rare and bloody lamb to be unappetizing. I prefer medium-rare to medium \u2014 still tender, with a hint of pink. We calibrated our cooking lesson below to this stage of doneness, but consult the cooking chart below if you like your lamb done differently. I will say that such a large cut of meat will probably have some variability; parts of the lamb leg were a little closer to medium, and others were closer to rare. <br> All of these cooking times take into account the fact that we broil the lamb first to sear it. They also assume a resting period of at least 15 minutes, during which the lamb actually continues cooking internally. It\u2019s best, especially if you like rare or medium-rare lamb, to take it out at a lower temperature than those officially recommended by the USDA. <br> <br>REMEMBER! <br>These times are only guidelines. Depending on many factors, your lamb leg may roast slower or faster. Check after one hour and then continue roasting, checking frequently, until the lamb reaches your desired internal temperature. <br> <br>Roasting Temperature:<br> 325\u00b0F <br> The primary takeaway, said Jamie, is that lamb is already a really tender cut of meat. Cooking should be simple. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll show you here: a simple, easy way to cook a tender and juicy leg of lamb every time. <br> A bone-in leg of lamb always surprises me with how easy it is to roast. This cut of lamb is always so flavorful, that just some garlic and rosemary is needed to flavor it. It may seem like a large piece of meat, but it\u2019s great as a holiday table centerpiece or a hearty dinner on a weekend that leaves you with leftovers for sandwiches or salads for the week. <br> Carving a leg of lamb is actually easier than carving a whole chicken, so we\u2019ve added some more photos to walk you through the whole process visually so that you have a beautiful serving platter of perfect lamb slices when you\u2019re all done. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Christine<br>, November 2018<br> <br> <br>This recipe was originally published April 2014.<br> ",

        "<br> Store-bought pizza dough, leftover chicken, BBQ sauce \u2026 check, check, check! This weeknight pizza couldn\u2019t be easier. It\u2019s savory, sweet, tangy, and it only takes 15 minutes of oven time. Who could ask for anything more? <br> I definitely took some shortcuts with the ingredient list here to minimize cooking time on weeknights. I always pick up some prepared dough from the grocery or pizza shop \u2014 this dough will keep in the fridge for up to three days \u2014 and then I just pull out some leftover cooked chicken breast for the topping. <br> Cilantro adds a fresh pop of flavor \u2014 sprinkle it on top right when the pizza comes out of the oven. <br> These pizzas made for such a great weeknight dinner. I took a cue from Stephanie and used a ball of store-bought pizza dough, so the pizzas came together in under 30 minutes. Store-bought dough is perfect for nights when you really want some pizza, but don\u2019t feel like doing too much in the kitchen. <br> I made one more change to the recipe, calling for low-moisture (aka dry) mozzarella instead of the water-packed variety. When I baked my first pizza with fresh mozzarella, the cheese weeped so much liquid that there was a big pool in the middle of my pizza. All that moisture meant that I wasn\u2019t able to get any browning on top without copious dabbing with paper towels, followed by a last-minute run under the broiler. <br> Use thinly sliced or shredded dry mozzarella instead \u2014 whichever is easier to find at the grocery store. The decreased moisture in the cheese translates to a pizza that\u2019s not water-logged, and it\u2019ll get nice and bubbly brown. <br> One last note: These pizzas are great for preassembling and <br>freezing<br>. The next time I have leftover cooked chicken on hand, I\u2019ll be sure to throw one of these together and pop it in the freezer for a busy night! <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Coco<br>, March 2015<br> ",

        "How To Make Stovetop Skillet Pizza",
        "<br> Hot summer days are tough for a pizza-lover \u2014 especially if that pizza-lover doesn\u2019t <br>have a grill<br> to take the pizza party outside. A few years back, my husband and I (both hardcore pizza devotees) started experimenting with stovetop pizzas to avoid turning our apartment into a sauna during the summer months, and this soon became a favorite technique. <br> Besides eliminating the need for a hot oven, stovetop pizzas are super fast and perfect for when you\u2019re just making one or two personal pizzas. Here\u2019s the method we\u2019ve settled on as our favorite. <br> The tricky part when cooking pizza on the stovetop is making sure the crust gets baked but doesn\u2019t start to burn. Start with cooking the crust by itself on high heat, then flip and reduce the heat to medium. This should be enough to develop golden, toasty spots on both sides without tipping it over into burning. It\u2019s fine to peek at the underside with a spatula and adjust the heat up or down as needed. <br> Once you\u2019ve cooked the first side and flipped the pizza crust, <br>then<br> add the toppings. Cover the pan to make sure the cheese melts and the other toppings get warmed through. For a more traditional oven-baked pizza, with all the crispy bits, you can run the pizza under the broiler for a minute or two toward the end of cooking. Once the cheese has melted to your liking, the pizza is ready! <br> Pizza, in general, is a great make-ahead dinner. You can prep everything, including the dough and toppings, and keep it all refrigerated until you\u2019re ready to cook. With everything ready to go, actually cooking these stovetop pizzas takes 10 minutes, tops. It\u2019s okay if the dough is still a little chilly from the fridge; it will still cook just fine! <br> I also think these stovetop pizzas are best suited for quick weeknight dinners for one or two! More than that, and I feel that one person would get stuck at the stove while everyone else at the party gets to chow down. No fun. For bigger parties, it\u2019s best to stick to the oven or grilling methods for cooking pizza. <br> Most pizza recipes insist you crank your oven as high as it will go, lest you serve a soggy slice. There is no way I\u2019m doing that in the dog days of summer or when my oven is already occupied during a holiday baking marathon. Stovetop skillet pizza is the smart solution. <br> Some cooks using Kitchn\u2019s original skillet pizza post wound up with burned bottoms and unmelted cheese. We hear you and have made some adjustments to ensure each stovetop pie you make is a success. Here are a few key updates for success. <br> We also included optional instructions for broiling the pizza at the very end if you want a deeply golden crust with lots of browned and bubbling cheese, but you won\u2019t be disappointed if you keep this a strictly stovetop affair. <br> \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, March 2018 ",

        "Recipe: Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting",
        "<br> My aunt is famous in my family for her carrot cake. This is partly due to the fact that she doesn\u2019t make it for just any old dinner or family gathering. It just magically shows up exactly when you need it. And with its tender cinnamon-scented crumb and thick layer of cream cheese frosting, yes, you definitely need it. <br> Far from <br>being a secret<br>, my aunt happily shared the recipe with me when I finally asked for it a while back. She admitted that she originally copied the recipe from a cookbook, though which exact one has long been forgotten. But she then went on to describe so many tweaks, adjustments, and variations that I\u2019m convinced this is now solely her own. <br> In turn, I have made my own tweaks and adjustments. My aunt prefers a layered round cake; I like a big, easily shared cake baked in a 9\u00d713-inch pan. My aunt adds nuts and raisins; I\u2019ll make mine with the carrots alone, please and thank you. My aunt uses a cooked frosting of cream, sugar, and cream cheese; I keep it simple with a very basic cream cheese frosting. <br> But the base recipe remains my aunt\u2019s, and it surpasses all other carrot cakes I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of sampling.

        "<br> There\u2019s a time to eat salad <br>with<br> your pizza, and then there\u2019s a time when salad is best eaten <br>on<br> your pizza. Right now it\u2019s time for the latter, when the flavors of Caesar salad and pizza team up and join forces for a delicious take on dinner. <br> This is the kind of pizza that can be as simple or involved as you want to make it. For a version that\u2019s ultra-convenient, lean on store-bought items like pre-made pizza dough, bottled dressing, rotisserie chicken or chicken breast from the salad bar, and pre-cut romaine. Of course if you\u2019re feeling up to it, you can also make your own <br>pizza dough<br>, <br>Caesar dressing<br>, and bake or grill the <br>chicken breasts<br>. <br> Think of the pizza dough as the stand-in for crunchy croutons. Instead of a pizza stone, reach for a large baking sheet. When baked against the lightly oiled metal pan, the dough cooks up with the crunchy bottom and crispy edges that makes pan pizza a classic. <br> <br>Read more: <br>Why I Don\u2019t Use a Baking Stone for Pizza<br> <br> <br>Serves 4 to 6<br> <br> 1 pound pizza dough, at room temperature 1 hour<br> Olive oil<br> 6 tablespoons creamy Caesar dressing, divided<br> 2 cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total), cubed<br> 1 cup grape tomatoes, quartered<br> 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese<br> 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese<br> 1 cup chopped romaine lettuce<br> 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice <br> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 450\u00b0F. <br> Lightly coat an 13\u00d718-inch rimmed baking sheet with oil. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet, then use your fingers to gently flatten and press the dough evenly into the bottom and corners of the pan. <br> Spread 5 tablespoons of Caesar dressing over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Top evenly with the chicken and tomatoes, followed by the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the edges are golden-brown, 16 to 20 minutes. <br> Let the pizza cool for 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, place the romaine, remaining 1 tablespoon Caesar dressing, and lemon juice in a medium bowl and toss to combine. Top the pizza with the dressed romaine. Cut into slices and serve immediately. <br> <br>Storage: <br>Leftover pizza can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. ",

Chili and cheese stuffed chicken breast may never win any beauty awards, but that\u2019s just fine because \u2014 as this quick dinner proves \u2014 it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. <br> I always make a point to slot this recipe into my meal plan after making a pot of chili. It\u2019s my ideal way to use up that last bit of leftovers that\u2019s not quite enough for a meal on its own. Alternatively, a can of chili from the pantry will work just as well. And as for the best chili for the job, anything and everything is fair game. <br> Preparing stuffed chicken breast has a way of feeling intimidating, especially if you\u2019ve never made it before, but I assure you \u2014 it\u2019s much easier than it might seem. It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s easy to pick up and get the hang of once you actually do it. The secret to success is using a sharp knife (boning and filleting knives work particularly well) and not cutting all the way through the chicken breast. When you\u2019re cutting, start small; remember, you can always make the pocket larger. ",

        "Recipe: Every Pizza Place Salad",
        "<br> Iceberg lettuce has fallen into deep disfavor with many cooks and food-lovers. Memories of bad, bland salads from our youth, and pale excuses for greenery on the plates of low-rent restaurants have pushed iceberg to the side in favor of more interesting greens: arugula, romaine, spicy microgreens. <br> But iceberg still has a place, and in the heat of summer I crave it like no other lettuce. Shaved thin, in a feathery pile, iceberg lettuce offers crisp, pure refreshment. In this salad, my own take on the Italian-American chopped salads of pizza parlors and pasta joints, iceberg shines. <br> Yes, this is a nod to those classic \u201cItalian chopped salads\u201d you find in pizza places all over the country, with their iceberg lettuce drenched in Italian dressing (out of a bottle) and with a handful of canned black olives thrown on top. I confess I rather like these salads; the best of them are crisp, refreshing, and running with juices. They are also easy eating; no big pieces of carrot or unwieldy greens to deal with. <br> I have been craving a salad inspired by these, but I wanted mine punched up just a bit, so I added radicchio (for a pleasant bitterness) and a lemon caper dressing that gives a salty tang to the proceedings. Ricotta salata is ricotta\u2019s firmer cousin (see <br>more about ricotta salata here<br>); it crumbles beautifully and has a gentle milkiness. You can substitute feta, if you want, although that will increase the saltiness of the salad and you may need to adjust the seasoning accordingly. <br> My husband and I love the cold, crisp, completely unfussy salad at great, hole-in-the-wall joints. Our ritual, regardless of the pizza spot we\u2019re at, is to share one before the pie arrives. This salad from Faith hits the mark on everything a good pizza-joint salad should be. It\u2019s loaded with crunchy iceberg lettuce, a bit of bitter radicchio for color and contrast, salty treats like olives and crumbled cheese, and then tossed in the most irresistible tangy lemon caper dressing. Now we can enjoy our unfussy favorite at home before pizza nights in our own kitchen. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, March 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Irish Soda Bread",
        "<br> Ah, Irish soda bread! Comparable only to cornbread in its many variations and allegiances, any Irish soda bread recipe is guaranteed to stir up a little controversy. I present this one for the simple reason that it\u2019s my favorite and you can adjust it any which way to suit your needs. Want it a little sweet? Add some sugar. Think it can\u2019t be Irish soda bread without currants and caraway? Have at it! <br> Most people agree on three Irish soda bread ingredients: flour, baking soda, and some kind of soured milk, usually buttermilk. But from there, it can vary widely and often with much debate. Some add sugar, and some do not. Some keep it all white flour, some add a little whole-wheat or rye flour, and some make it a 100 percent whole-grain bread. Some add a fat such as butter, but some people melt it and some like to cut it in cold. Salt, too, is controversial, as well as the addition of an egg or two. And we haven\u2019t even begun to talk about caraway, raisins, or orange peel! <br> In choosing an Irish soda bread recipe, your first decision will be sweet or savory. The addition of sugar is technically not traditional, but it\u2019s still good. I do not include sugar in my main recipe, but suggest an amount in the optional ingredients, as I will sometimes add sugar to my Irish soda bread if I know I will be serving it with jam or marmalade. <br> My recipe also doesn\u2019t contain eggs, which to me promotes a cake-like texture, especially if you\u2019re also adding sugar. I like to cut in some cold butter to help keep the texture light and flakey. And I also like to add a little whole-wheat flour for taste and texture. <br> Many people like to add dried fruit to their soda bread, such as raisins or currants, and I have no problem with that. I also don\u2019t mind dried herbs or spices such as caraway or dill. A little grated orange or lemon peel is nice, too. I\u2019ve included these in the list of optional ingredients since they can swing the bread in a particular direction. <br> I like to bake my soda bread in a cast iron skillet, as it promotes a nice crust, but you can certainly use a flat baking sheet. Be sure to score an X into the dough and make it fairly deep \u2014 about 1/2- to 3/4-inch. One of the challenges of a soda bread is being sure that the center is done, and the X helps the heat to penetrate the bread. It also creates extra surface area for the crisp, crackling crust. ",

            " Bake for 25 minutes. Check the bread: If it is getting too brown, tent with a piece of aluminum foil. Continue baking 20 to 30 minutes more.

        "<br> Sometimes the simplest ingredients, combined in the simplest of ways, have the power to stop time, erase your woes, and transport you to a place of nirvana-like bliss. Such is the power of the margherita pizza. Fresh tomato sauce, chewy mozzarella cheese, a sprinkling of basil on a crispy crust? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you started levitating. <br> I am not a strict purist when it comes to margherita, or margarita, pizza. I like the crust to be crispy, but still with a little chew. When tomatoes are in season and so very ripe, I\u2019ll use them over the traditional San Marzano tomatoes imported from Italy. I also really like a clove of garlic and a few basil leaves in my sauce. Slices of fresh mozzarella, buffalo or otherwise, are a must. <br> If you\u2019ve never made your own pizza sauce before, this recipe will convince you otherwise \u2014 if you can even call it a recipe. All you do is blend ripe tomatoes in a food processor or blender until they\u2019re good and saucy. To prevent an overly watery sauce (and the subsequently soggy pizza crust), I usually squeeze the tomatoes of excess liquid before blending or strain the sauce afterwards to make it thicker. <br> No need to cook this sauce ahead of time, either. When spread thinly on the crust, it will cook just enough in the oven to perk up its flavors. <br> If it\u2019s too hot to contemplate turning on the oven where you live, definitely try making this pizza on the grill. I can only imagine that the smokiness and high heat of the grill will make a margherita pizza even more nirvana-inducing. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>How To Grill Pizza<br> ",

        "Recipe: Weeknight White Chicken Chili",
        "<br> While this recipe reminds me of a chowder \u2014 with its rich, ultra-creamy broth and chunky textures \u2014 the warm, smoky cumin and trio of fresh, punchy toppings leave it firmly planted in chili territory. It\u2019s quick enough to slot into your midweek meal plan, and it yields excellent leftovers. <br> My favorite trick when making any chili or soup that includes shredded chicken is to poached the chicken right in the pot, alongside all the other ingredients. It\u2019s hugely efficient, making one less pot to wash and, best of all, the lean meat picks up a lot of extra flavor \u2014 a total boon to quick-simmered weeknight chili. Here, as the chicken poaches, it picks up the smoky scent of cumin, warm heat from the chiles, and a subtle sweetness from the onion. <br> While you can certainly make this chili starting with leftover rotisserie or shredded chicken, which will save some time, it does mean sacrificing some flavor. Using pre-cooked chicken means missing out on the warm, smoky, chili-tinged aromas that get infused into the meat when starting with uncooked chicken breast. ",

        "<br> I\u2019m probably like most people and only cook corned beef once a year, on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, but I\u2019ve always wondered why I don\u2019t make it more often. Since I <br>use a slow cooker<br>, this comforting dinner is mostly hands-off and pretty easy. What I really enjoy most is turning the leftovers into corned beef hash the next day for breakfast. Two meals for the effort of one? You can\u2019t beat that! <br> There\u2019s honestly no one way to make corned beef hash. Some swear by mixing the vegetables from a corned beef dinner into the hash, while some like to finely chop the meat to form patties. <br> This version \u2014 the simple, classic version \u2014 is how I generally like to make it. While it tastes best with corned beef made with brisket, I\u2019ve also had great success just buying the corned beef from the deli counter that\u2019s used in sandwiches. Boiled starchy potatoes add bulk, red bell pepper adds color and sweetness, and of course, any hash needs to starts with saut\u00e9ed onions and finish with a runny fried egg. <br> One thing to remember with this recipe is to use a nonstick frying pan or seasoned cast iron skillet to get a good sear on the potatoes. This breakfast is substantial enough on its own and truly makes a stupendous brunch. ",

        "<br> The simple corn muffin is a beautiful thing. You can serve this make-ahead marvel as a side dish and then eat any leftovers for a quick breakfast. <br> But we can do better than just tossing some cornmeal in a bowl. These muffins are laced deliciously with shredded sharp cheddar and slivered jalape\u00f1os. The flavor combination is a perfect match. <br> For jalape\u00f1o prep, I recommend scraping out the seeds and then slicing the pepper into half-rounds instead of dicing it \u2014 that will make the peppers really stand out in the finished muffin. <br> You might also think that a whole jalape\u00f1o is a lot for just a few small muffins, but the spice is mellowed by the roasting and also by the cheese, so don\u2019t fear the pepper. <br> Don\u2019t be afraid to really fill your muffin tin with the batter. These will puff nicely, but not to the extent of cupcakes; you don\u2019t need to worry about them overflowing. I also like to top each muffin with a few slivered jalape\u00f1o slices for effect. <br> I\u2019ll argue that savory muffins are the ultimate accompaniment to a bowl of chili or juicy pulled pork. They\u2019ve got great texture, thanks to the cornmeal, are salty and nutty, due to the cheddar, and have just the right amount of kick from the jalape\u00f1o. I actually lowered the amount of sugar originally called for in the recipe, as I really felt it didn\u2019t need and it took away from the other great flavors. <br> <br>\u2013<br> Sheela<br>, March 2018<br> ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Chili Mac and Cheese",
        "<br> Ultra-comforting slow-cooker chili mac is the love child of macaroni and cheese and chili \u2014 perfect for the person who just can\u2019t choose. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, with lots of gooey, melted cheese and tender pasta mixed with a hearty blend of spices, meat, and beans. This is your chance to get it all in the same bowl. <br> This recipe is our 2.0 version of slow cooker mac and cheese. The first was good, but if we\u2019re being honest it was a little fussy and we knew we could do better. So we did. If you\u2019ve made this recipe before, you\u2019ll quickly notice that this new and improved version is pretty different! <br> Regardless of whether you\u2019re on Team Mac and Cheese or Team Chili, it\u2019s best to let the chili take the lead in this two-for-one comfort food. It starts with a richly flavored beef and bean chili, flecked with a mess of spices, that simmers all day long in the slow cooker. Then, just at the end of cooking, cooked elbow noodles and cheese get stirred in with an extra layer of cheese sprinkled and melted over the top. You can certainly make the noodles just before they get added to the slow cooker, but I like to get a head-start by making them during my weekend meal prep and then stashing them in the fridge until I need them.

        "How To Make a Frittata with Whatever You Have on Hand",
        "<br> Frittatas have saved me on more hungry weeknights than I care to count. As long as I have a few vegetables and maybe a little meat to throw in a skillet, I can have a frittata on the table in about 20 minutes. Let me tell you, there is <br>nothing<br> better than diving into a plate of steaming veggie-filled eggs when you\u2019re home late and starving. <br> Frittatas were once my <br>culinary nemesis<br>. Everyone else seemed to think they were so easy-peasy, but mine always turned out dry or bland or unappetizing for one reason or another. Through trial and error, I learned some nifty tricks and gradually refined my technique. Almost without realizing it, frittatas became a regular visitor to my weeknight meal rotation. <br> In retrospect, I think I was making frittatas out to be more complicated than they actually are. There\u2019s not really a \u201cright\u201d way to make them. The method I describe here is what consistently works for me, but I have no doubt that you will make tweaks of your own once you head into the kitchen. <br> So how do you make a great frittata every time without always using a recipe? The answer is a ratio. <br>For every six eggs, use 1/4 cup heavy cream, 1 cup cheese, and 2 cups total of vegetables and/or meat<br>. This will get you a frittata with a hearty filling \u2014 especially if you\u2019re using something like potatoes and bacon \u2014 and a creamy egg custard shot through with the tang of cheese. <br> One frittata makes plenty for four to six people with a side salad or other steamed vegetable, and more than enough for two. The leftovers are nearly as good as frittata straight from the oven. I like to eat a wedge on top of a piece of toast for an easy lunch. And while I mostly rely on frittatas as a quick-fix dinner, they are wonderful for a hearty breakfast any day of the week, too. <br> Frittatas are everything to love about a quiche without the fuss of a crust. A simple whisk of eggs and dairy poured over saut\u00e9ed veggies (and/or meat) and you have a dish you can serve any time of day. Kitchn\u2019s original frittata post was more a formula and less a recipe \u2014 like the choose-your-own adventure books we read as kids, there was a list of suggested fillings and a wide range of amounts offered for egg, dairy, and seasoning. <br> Although this approach has served readers well, in this update we share our favorite iteration of the dish (let\u2019s just say there are potatoes, bacon, spinach, and cheese involved!). Use 6 eggs to 1/4 cup heavy cream for a tender, creamy custard. This streamlined recipe will make it easier to execute and experiment. <br> \u2014<br>Patty<br>, March 2018 ",

        "Brunch Recipe for a Crowd: Country Ham & Onion Quiche Baked in a Sheet Pan",
        "<br> Quiche is the quintessential spring dish, whether served as a nibble before the main event or as the shining star of a casual brunch. In this ham and onion version you\u2019ll find a method for a quick and easy savory shortbread crust that\u2019s so simple all you have to do is pat it directly into the pan. <br> For the custard, I tripled my favorite onion and ham tart recipe and used a tip I learned from Thomas Keller to make sure there was goodness in every bite: Mix the batter in the blender to create lots and lots of bubbles to help suspend the filling ingredients instead of letting them sink to the bottom. <br> I\u2019m excited to say that everything came together to create a sublime quiche \u2014 a beyond buttery crust, a creamy custard, and flavorful bursts of onion and ham. It definitely feeds a crowd, so make sure you have some hungry mouths to feed. <br> Quiche for a crowd with no muffin cups to clean? Amazing! This is just right for Sunday brunches or showers for babies and brides. When party planning, I look for spots to streamline. Nealy, the post\u2019s original author, included an intriguing tip garnered from famed chef Thomas Keller: Use a blender to aerate the custard to encourage suspension of quiche fillings. It\u2019s a clever tip, but I\u2019ll try it when preparing a deeper egg pie. <br> For this shallow sheet pan version I\u2019m sticking to a simple whisk. Country ham and vidalia onion are classic Southern ingredients. Bacon can surely be substituted, but since the ham needs no precooking, I\u2019ll reach for it when party prepping. Just remember \u2014 country ham is quite salty, so small pieces are ideal. <br> \u2013<br>Patty<br>, March 2018 ",

        "How To Make Breakfast Pizza",
        "<br> If cold leftover pizza is a breakfast you\u2019d rather leave as a college memory, but the idea of pizza for breakfast still appeals, then this recipe is for you. You can find breakfast pizza pretty much anywhere, but there\u2019s a <br>version popular in the Midwest<br> that we\u2019re pretty smitten with. This regional speciality might seem standard at first \u2014 sausage, eggs, and cheese on a basic crust \u2014 but when you look closer, you\u2019ll find a creamy cheese sauce in place of a haphazard handful of cheese, and hash browns tucked in under the layer of meat and eggs. It\u2019s those details that make this gas station pizza one to be inspired by. <br> While you can make the entire pizza from start to finish in about an hour on a weekend morning, you can also make most of the toppings the night before and bake this pizza up in less than 30 minutes any day of the week. <br> The most famous Midwestern breakfast pizza was born from a chain of convenience stores in Iowa called Casey\u2019s General Store. Casey\u2019s locations make and sell breakfast pizzas all day long. Standard pizza dough is topped with their signature cheese sauce, sausage, scrambled eggs, and cheese. While you can switch out the other toppings, the cheese sauce really is the secret to making a breakfast pizza like Casey\u2019s. <br> So how do you make a pizza for breakfast? The answer is the simple one you\u2019re expecting: Top it with standard breakfast fare, but do it with some finesse. Ours gets sausage, hash browns, and scrambled eggs because it\u2019s hearty, delicious, and reheats well. This recipe reads long, but you can make the cheese sauce, cook the sausage and eggs, and grate the cheese the night before and just assemble the pizza the next day. <br> Breakfast pizza is a great way to use up leftovers. Cube leftover frittata (or <br>breakfast casserole<br>) and put that on the pizza instead of the scrambled eggs, or swap the hash browns for leftover roasted vegetables from last night\u2019s dinner. The formula of pizza crust + cheese sauce + cheese + toppings will make those leftovers exciting again. ",

        "How To Make the Best Cheesy Quesadillas",
        "<br> The humble quesadilla wears many hats. It\u2019s a quick weeknight meal that can transform yesterday\u2019s leftovers into something new and tasty. It\u2019s also a fuss-free snack that will satisfy a group of hungry teenagers \u2014 or the crowd at your next cocktail party. Fill it with plain cheese and beans or with shrimp and avocado; the quesadilla is whatever you want to make it. <br> Making quesadillas is about as easy as it comes. Warm a tortilla in a skillet and top with cheese and fillings. Wait until everything is warm and gooey, then fold and dig in. I prefer flour tortillas for quesadillas \u2014 they\u2019re usually easier to find in the larger 9- or 10-inch size and they get nicely crispy in the pan without breaking apart when you fold or cut them. <br> One trick \u2014 a surprising trick! \u2014 is to use only a little bit of butter or oil in the pan when cooking the quesadillas. Too much and I find the tortilla ends up soggy and greasy instead of crispy. Just a half teaspoon or so to coat the bottom of the pan ensures a crispy tortilla with golden-brown spots. <br> Play with the burner temperature, too. On my electric stove, medium heat will cook the quesadilla in a few minutes, with the cheese melting and the tortilla crisping almost simultaneously. On gas stoves in former apartments, I usually cooked the quesadillas over slightly higher heat. <br> My only other word of advice is to keep it simple with the fillings. Stick to just a few ingredients and only use about 1/2 cup or so per quesadilla. The melted cheese will hold the filling in place once the tortilla is folded and help prevent it from tumbling out on the plate. Don\u2019t feel limited to just South American ingredients either! The quesadilla is really just a vehicle for whatever combinations of ingredients your imagination can create. <br> <br> Do you love quesadillas? What are your favorite fillings?<br> ",

        "How To Quickly Cook Spinach on the Stovetop",
        "<br> Spinach is an unsung hero of dinner greens. It doesn\u2019t require the long, slow braise that <br>collards and kale<br> need, and it can be served simply with salt and butter or dressed up with <br>cheese or cream<br>. <br> There are a few basic ways to cook spinach. You can blanch it or steam it, or you can take the fastest route and saut\u00e9 it in a pan. All you need is spinach, a pan, and a pair of tongs. <br> Spinach is a tender, leafy green that contains quite a lot of water. This is why I prefer the saut\u00e9 method over blanching or steaming whenever a recipe calls for cooked spinach. Saut\u00e9ing will cook off some of the excess water, which is really helpful in general, but especially if the spinach is being added as an ingredient to things like quiche or lasagna. <br> <br>Wash and dry the spinach:<br> Add the spinach to a bowl or sink full of cold water, gently swishing it around to dislodge any dirt. Do not agitate it too much, as you want the dirt to sink to the bottom of the bowl. Remove the spinach to a clean dry towel and pat it dry. <br> <br>Cook in a wide frying pan with high sides:<br> When cooking spinach, it\u2019s best to use a frying pan with high sides, although a wok also works very well. The volume of spinach will be overwhelming at first, and the high sides help to keep things contained. The wide surface area of a frying pan also helps expose as much of the spinach to heat as possible, allowing it to wilt evenly and evaporate liquid quickly. <br> <br>Continue to add fresh spinach as the salted spinach cooks down:<br> The spinach will quickly wilt, however, and become more manageable in no time. It\u2019s even possible to continue to feed the pan with handfuls of fresh spinach as it wilts and more room is created. <br> <br>Cool in a single layer to avoid overcooking:<br> Once the spinach is cooked, move it to a plate or baking sheet and use the tongs to spread it out into a single layer. This steps slows carryover cooking and prevents overcooked spinach. <br> <br>Squeeze out even more moisture, if desired:<br> If you are using the spinach in a recipe such as a quiche or as a filling, you will need to squeeze out any excess water. Once the spinach has cooled, gather it into a ball and squeeze as hard as you can. Be sure to do this standing over the sink or, if you want to save the spinach juice, into a bowl. You may have to do this in batches, or you can use a <br>use a potato ricer<br> if you have one. <br> Stovetop saut\u00e9ing usually calls for at least a teaspoon of oil. I do not use oil to cook spinach that will later be used in a recipe, such as for quiche or spanakopita. It\u2019s not really necessary since spinach is so full of water that it immediately begins to release liquid upon contact with the hot pan, and I find that adding extra oil here can make the final dish oily. The water protects it while it is cooking, making it unnecessary to add a cooking fat. If, however, you are cooking the spinach as a side dish, you may want to start with onions or garlic cooked in oil or butter. ",

        "How To Make Homemade Pizza Sauce",
        "<br> Tomato sauce for homemade pizzas is one of the all-time easiest DIY projects. It\u2019s made with just a few ingredients \u2014 canned tomatoes, garlic, balsamic vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil \u2014 and a quick blitz in the blender or food processor. You can even freeze it in single pizza-sized portions to make things all the easier for yourself on pizza night! <br> Here is your step-by-step recipe, with everything you need to know to make homemade pizza sauce tonight. <br> Canned tomatoes are just great for making homemade pizza sauce. You can use whole or diced tomatoes, but make sure no spices or herbs have been added. You want basic, everyday, plain tomatoes here! Fresh tomatoes can be used too, but can make a watery sauce; use only paste tomatoes, or squeeze the tomatoes of excess liquid before blending. <br> Any variety of tomatoes works just fine for making pizza sauce \u2014 even your grocery-store brand. For the classic Neapolitan pizza experience, however, pick up a can of <br>San Marzano tomatoes<br>. They\u2019re a little sweeter and meatier than other varieties, and they can really level-up your sauce game for pizza night. <br> This pizza sauce is ready to be used as soon as it\u2019s blended \u2014 no cooking needed! Spoon it right onto the pizza, cover with additional toppings, and bake. If you\u2019d like a thicker sauce, strain the tomatoes from their juices before blending. <br> This isn\u2019t just for convenience \u2014 a no-cook sauce will actually taste better on your pizza, giving you that fresh, zippy tomato flavor, even after it has been baked in a hot oven. <br> The first time I made this sauce I was a skeptic: A no-cook pizza sauce made from canned tomatoes? That sounded too simple and easy to be good. Thankfully, I can admit when I\u2019m wrong. Some readers commented that the sauce as originally written was watery with a strong balsamic vinegar flavor. I agreed and added instructions to drain the tomatoes and reduce the vinegar. <br> Since this sauce does not require cooking, questions also arose about including raw garlic. I can assure you that the garlic flavor is pleasant, not pungent. There is no need for a knife and cutting board since the food processor does all of the work \u2014 and no, the sauce isn\u2019t bitter from pur\u00e9eing the tomato seeds. A little bit of sugar and specified amounts for salt and pepper mean this sauce is everything you would expect from your neighborhood pizzeria. <br> \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, March 2018 ",

        "<br> Can you bake or slow-cook frozen chicken? Nope \u2026 but you can pressure-cook it! Toss rock-hard frozen pieces of chicken into the pressure cooker and serve fall-off-the bone flavorful meat in less than 30 minutes. <br> Slow-cooking, stovetop simmering, or oven braising frozen chicken will keep it in the \u201cdanger zone,\u201d (temperatures between 40\u00b0F and 140\u00b0F) long enough for the meat to host a stomach-wrenching bacteria party. Pressure-cooking meat with this method shoots the frozen chicken quickly past this zone and neutralizes any stragglers. <br> According to the USDA, any raw meat and poultry that\u2019s been in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d too long has allowed bacteria to multiply and grow enough to produce toxins. In addition to the bacteria, it\u2019s those toxins that cause foodborne illnesses. Although bacteria is obliterated by the time the food boils, the heat-resistant toxins cannot be destroyed by the cooking process (even a low-and-slow eight-hour-long process), making even the fully cooked meat that has lingered in the danger zone too long unsafe to eat. <br> To pressure-cook chicken from frozen, you\u2019ll need to make four adjustments to the recipe: boil it, adjust the pressure-cooking time, expect delays, and check the internal temperature. <br> Covering the frozen chicken with liquid ensures the heat will be transferred into most of the meat in the least amount of time. Making that cooking liquid flavorful will impart extra seasoning to the meat as well. <br> Increase the recommended pressure-cooking time for that cut of meat 50 percent or more. (In this case, bone-in chicken pieces usually require 10 minutes of pressure-cooking time, but going from frozen, that time is increased to 15 minutes.) <br> The pressure cooker will take slightly longer to reach pressure \u2014 that\u2019s because the liquid that needs to boil inside in order to build pressure has a giant chicken ice cube in it. Depending on how much meat and liquid is in there, expect the cooker to take five to 10 minutes longer to build pressure. Some electric pressure cookers have a detector that turns off the cooker if it doesn\u2019t reach pressure in a set amount of time. If this happen,s simply turn off the cooker, turn it back on, and reprogram the cooking time. <br> Lastly, to make sure that the right amount of heat got all the way to the middle of the chicken, slip a meat thermometer down to the bone and check that the internal temperature has reached 165\u00b0F. <br> Using fresh, not frozen, chicken? Make this pressure-cooker cacciatore chicken recipe the same way, but cut down the pressure-cooking time to 10 minutes. ",

        "Weeknight Dinner Recipe: Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza",
        "<br> In a blazing-hot oven, a homemade pizza bakes in under 10 minutes, but that doesn\u2019t always make it a quick meal option. With all the chopping and precooking some toppings require, it often seems easier to pick up the phone and order delivery \u2014 especially at the end of a tiring day. <br> Instead, give this weeknight-friendly pizza recipe a try. Topped with a layer of chewy, crisp-edged prosciutto and finished with a couple of handfuls of fresh, peppery arugula, it comes together in a flash \u2014 no chopping or precooking necessary. <br> The combination of fatty, salty prosciutto and spicy arugula is a classic, which is why I\u2019ve been making this particular pizza for years. I used to tear up the prosciutto and randomly scatter it over the dough before baking, but I\u2019ve since discovered that paving the surface of the pizza with an even layer of pork is the way to go. When done this way, every bite includes some prosciutto. <br> Hot out of the oven, the pizza is scattered with a generous amount of arugula, which softens a little at the edges but doesn\u2019t wilt, lending a spicy bite that cuts through the salty porkiness of the prosciutto. <br> And on busy nights, I appreciate that the only ingredient prep this recipe requires is opening a couple of packages. Even on weekends when I have a little more time and am making several pizzas for a group of friends, a prosciutto and arugula pie will invariably make its way onto the menu. It\u2019s quick, it\u2019s easy, and everyone always always loves it. Isn\u2019t that the very definition of pizza? <br> This is a recipe that has long been in my rotation for weekly pizza night in my house. It\u2019s super simple to assemble yet feels a touch more unique than your classic margarita pizza. The arugula adds a peppery, fresh touch to things and really does make it all too easy to want to go in for a second slice. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, March 2018<br> ",

Because really and truly, these breakfast tacos can be enjoyed any morning of the week. The key to making them weekday-friendly is getting a head-start during meal prep. <br> These tacos start with a skillet of crispy bacon and a mix of diced potato, onion, and sweet bell pepper. Get a jump on breakfast by prepping these two components in advance, and then stash them in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to eat. Come morning, all that\u2019s left to do is to give it a quick reheat on the stovetop while you scramble the eggs. ",

        "How To Make Calzones at Home",
        "<br> Calzones are a favorite in my house \u2014 not only for a <br>relaxed weekend dinner<br>, but also for wrapping up, freezing, and eating for lunches <br>all week long<br>. Whether you enjoy them for lunch or dinner, they\u2019re the perfect little \u201chot pockets\u201d (ahem!) of cheese, veggies, and leftover meat. Here\u2019s how to make them. <br> Think of calzones as the original Hot Pocket, reportedly created as a way to eat pizza on the go in 18th century Naples (at that time, pizza was eaten \u201cproperly\u201d with a knife and fork). The idea is pretty simple: Fold pizza dough around the toppings so you can eat dinner with one hand and not worry about losing any cheese. <br> I see calzones as the perfect vehicles for using up leftover odds and ends in the fridge. The traditional filling of spinach and ricotta is fantastic, but I also like to play with leftover steak, pulled chicken, grilled veggies, wilted greens, chickpeas, feta, goat cheese, and whatever else sounds good that day. <br> You can reduce the chance of a calzone explosion five ways. <br> These calzones are such a good make-ahead meal that I often make a double batch. Some get eaten right away, and the rest go in the freezer for lunch emergencies or quick dinners. If you\u2019re eating them fresh out the oven, allow them to cool a few minutes so you don\u2019t burn your mouth. <br> To freeze, let any leftover calzones cool completely, then wrap each individual calzone tightly in plastic wrap. Transfer to a plastic freezer bag and freeze. <br> Thaw the calzone for a few hours in the fridge, or extend the cooking time to reheat from frozen. If you put one in your lunch bag in the morning, it will be thawed enough by lunchtime. Don\u2019t forget to remove the plastic wrap before reheating. You can reheat them in the microwave in one-minute bursts on HIGH (2 to 3 minutes total) or in the oven or a toaster oven at 300\u00b0F until heated through. ",

        "How To Make the Easiest Cinnamon Rolls",
        "<br> Homemade cinnamon rolls never seem like a project you can undertake in the morning and have ready in time for breakfast, right? All those ingredients to measure out, kneading in a stand mixer, and of course, two rises for the yeast to do its thing. It\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re also picking them up from a bakery, IKEA, and even that chain in the mall. <br> What if I told you that you could put a big pan of cinnamon rolls together in about the same amount of time it takes for your oven to heat? With just seven ingredients (all staples you can keep in your pantry and fridge), you can make fragrant iced cinnamon rolls without a stand mixer, prolonged kneading, or rising time. Let\u2019s make this magic happen! <br> Traditional cinnamon rolls get their signature tender, doughy texture from a rich yeasted dough. They\u2019re pillowy-soft, like a cinnamon-scented pillow, but all of this comes at a price: time. Yeast needs lots of time to rise properly, and cinnamon rolls usually need two rises: once when the dough is made, and once more after the rolls are formed. <br> To make these easier cinnamon rolls a feasible breakfast option, we ditched the yeast in favor of self-rising flour. Self-rising flour is a combination of all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. There\u2019s enough baking powder in there to give these cinnamon rolls a nice puff and lift. The finished cinnamon rolls won\u2019t be as pillowy as their yeasted cousins, but they are still plenty soft and have a great texture. <br> This easy dough is a mixture of the self-rising flour, sugar, milk, and melted butter, and it\u2019s just stirred together in a big bowl. The dough is kneaded by hand ever-so-briefly (and by briefly, I mean about a minute), but it has such a great texture that you can roll it out immediately too. <br> After the dough\u2019s rolled out, the next steps are pretty much like most other cinnamon roll recipes: Brush the dough with butter, sprinkle with plenty of cinnamon-sugar, then roll it into a log and cut into rounds. <br> Homemade cinnamon rolls go <br>fast<br>, so we use our trusty 9\u00d713-inch baking dish here to make 15 good-sized rolls. More is a good thing when it comes to cinnamon rolls. <br> While the rolls are baking, whisk together a simple icing of powdered sugar, milk, and salt to glaze the finished rolls with when they come out of the oven. For those who prefer a cream cheese glaze, give <br>Faith\u2019s version<br> a try. <br> Fresh, warm, homemade cinnamon rolls are waiting for you \u2014 just grab a bag of self-rising flour and give these a whirl!

        "How To Make Perfect Chocolate Pudding from Scratch",
        "<br> What would the world be without chocolate pudding? Chocolate and cream, licked off a spoon, is one of the greatest desserts I know, ranked with fresh strawberry shortcake and warm chocolate chip cookies. But pudding has become a lost art as baking books proliferate; it only shows up in Snack Packs or on restaurant dessert plates. <br> This is a secret opportunity for you as a cook, because pudding is special and unusual, and yet a snap to make. Knowing how to make pudding from scratch is like having the golden key to <br>winning<br> dessert. <br> I am biased, I confess \u2014 I wrote<br> a whole book about pudding, custard, and no-bake desserts<br> so I\u2019ve spent some time with these sweets. And yet I love them more and more. Come on into my kitchen and let me show you how to make rich and creamy chocolate pudding. It\u2019s a forgotten classic that every sweet-lover should know by heart. <br> Pudding\u2019s glamour can\u2019t be overstated. At first look it\u2019s homey and old-fashioned, but dress it up right and it\u2019s a dessert that drives everyone wild. Homemade pudding, whipped and ever so slightly warm, makes people\u2019s eyes go wide. It\u2019s love in a bowl. <br> The other little pudding secret, of course, is that it\u2019s naturally gluten-free. Like ice cream, as long as pudding is made with gluten-free ingredients, it\u2019s a welcome treat for celiacs and gluten-intolerant folks. Come to think of it, pudding is basically ice cream for the refrigerator \u2014 rich, creamy, infinitely adaptable to your whims, a scoop to please anyone. (But it won\u2019t melt on the dessert buffet.) <br> I could go on and on \u2014 but all these points are academic until you dip into a bowl of homemade chocolate pudding. So let\u2019s get started! <br> The process of making pudding \u2014 any pudding \u2014 is easy. Pudding is simply milk and cream, sweetened and thickened by a brief bout of cooking on the stovetop or in the oven. <br> Unbaked puddings, like this one, get their richness and thickness from a mixture of cornstarch and egg yolks. Chocolate pudding gets an extra boost from the chocolate itself, so you need less when you\u2019re finishing the pudding with a handful of chocolate. <br> I also use both cocoa and chocolate for a richer flavor. This isn\u2019t a super-rich chocolate mousse, eaten by the thimbleful, but it\u2019s still rich enough for grown-ups, and not too sweet. You can mellow it out by omitting the cocoa, if you like, or by using semisweet chocolate instead of bittersweet. You can stir in instant espresso powder to go mocha, or dash in a slug of bourbon. As I said \u2014 infinitely adaptable. <br> I know I\u2019m a pushy pudding evangelist, but really \u2014 I just want everyone to have the sweet experience of setting homemade pudding on the table. It\u2019s pure delight, and isn\u2019t that part of what cooking is all about? <br> Want more puddings like this one? I\u2019d love to share my book <br>Bakeless Sweets<br> with you. It\u2019s chock-full of homemade puddings, panna cotta, grain puddings, fruit jellies, trifles, and no-bake cookies and icebox cakes. Beyond chocolate and vanilla there\u2019s butterscotch pudding, Nutella pudding, even maple bourbon pudding! <br> ",

        "How To Make Cauliflower Rice or Couscous",
        "<br> I don\u2019t say this very often, but, friends, cauliflower \u201ccouscous\u201d or \u201crice\u201d is <br>mind-blowing<br>. Zero exaggeration. It\u2019s light and fluffy. It takes five minutes to make. It can replace couscous or rice in any dish \u2014 hot or cold, side dish or otherwise. Talk about a food crush. <br> Don\u2019t wait a second more: Here\u2019s a step-by-step recipe that shows how you can make cauliflower rice, too. <br> I admit to a fair amount of skepticism when I first heard about cauliflower rice and couscous from my Paleo and grain-free friends. I am already distrustful of healthy food<br> disguised as comfort food<br>, and when I thought about cauliflower as a stand-in for either couscous or rice, I just couldn\u2019t make the math work in my head. No way a crunchy cruciferous veggie like cauliflower could convince me to pass up a scoop of rice with my dinner. <br> Well, I should get a slap on the wrist for this one. Please don\u2019t wait as long as I did before you try it for yourself. <br> Cauliflower couscous is surprisingly grain-like. No, it probably wouldn\u2019t win in a side-by-side taste test with either couscous or white rice, but it does a fair job of coming close. It\u2019s light and fluffy, like couscous. It\u2019s also tender and has just the right amount of chew, like rice. <br> You make this copycat couscous by pulsing cauliflower florets in a food processor (or grating them on a box grater) until they\u2019ve broken down into tiny granules. Eaten raw, the grains are tender but crunchy with a mild flavor. Raw cauliflower couscous can be used like cooked grains in salads like <br>tabbouleh<br> or any of these <br>hearty lunch salads<br>. <br> Quickly cooked in a little butter or olive oil on the stovetop, the couscous becomes softer and more tender. It can be served just like rice as a side dish for curry, stir-fry, or beans. I\u2019ve also used it in a <br>fried \u201crice\u201d dish<br> and as a filling for burritos. I haven\u2019t yet tried it in a casserole, but I feel confident the cauliflower couscous would hold its own there, too. <br> Bottom line: Whether you\u2019re trying to sneak more vegetables into your day or are avoiding grains (or heck, even if you just want another idea for the dinner table), cauliflower \u201ccouscous\u201d is something you need in your life.

        "How To Make One-Bowl Microwave Macaroni and Cheese",
        "<br> This mac and cheese is for those times when you just can\u2019t be bothered to pull out a pan. You need some cheesy goodness, and you need it now. One bowl. All yours. No leftovers. <br> I originally learned this method of making easy mac and cheese in the microwave from Beth Sheresh in her book, <br>Picture Yourself Cooking With Your Kids<br>. In the book, she includes a recipe for a full batch of mac and cheese made entirely in the microwave and using only a handful of very basic ingredients. Inspired by this, I thought I\u2019d try a single-serving version made right in the bowl. <br> Both Beth\u2019s original recipe and my single-bowl version are perfect for older children and teens who are ready to take responsibility for their own after-school snacks. For us grownups, it also makes the perfect after-meeting snack at the office \u2013 just pack the raw macaroni and a handful of shredded cheese with your lunch and snag a splash of milk from the coffee cart. Apologies in advance for your jealous coworkers. <br> If you\u2019re at home, you can also jazz up your bowl however you like. Throw in some leftover veggies or cooked meat. Add a few pinches of your favorite spice mix or a squeeze of Sriracha. If you have some goat cheese or feta crumbles to add to your cheese scenario, all the better. <br> One thing to watch out for: During the initial few minutes of cooking the pasta, the water can sometimes bubble up and get very foamy in some microwaves. Use a deeper bowl than you might otherwise think you\u2019d need, or just stop the microwave and stir the pasta if you see this happening. <br> The bowl can also get quite warm during microwaving. Use oven mitts or a kitchen towel to handle the bowl if you need to move it in and out of the microwave during cooking. <br> I had completely forgotten how brilliant this little microwave trick can be. It\u2019s so easy \u2013 perfect for a snack or a quick dinner when I\u2019m eating on my own. There\u2019s just something so very nice about being able to make yourself a bowl of creamy mac and cheese without pulling out a pan or turning on the stove. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Emma<br>, May 2015<br> ",

        "<br> One of the things I love most about pasta is how accommodating it is to any schedule. Have a weekend to roll homemade dough and stuff pockets of ravioli with hand-pulled mozzarella? Go for it, baby. Have an afternoon to slow-cook a perfect meaty rag\u00f9? The rewards will be rich. <br> But let\u2019s say you need to prep dinner in 10 minutes. You can\u2019t even boil a pot of water in that amount of time, but pasta is still your friend! Meet the no-boil pasta bake. <br> Yes, this pasta casserole doesn\u2019t even require cooked pasta \u2014 just dried. It will take you five minutes to prep for the oven \u2014 no, I\u2019m not exaggerating. Pour some dry pasta into a casserole dish, open a can of tomatoes, dump in some cheese and garlic, and bang the whole thing into the oven. An hour later you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ve done a magic trick: hot, gooey, bubbling noodles and cheese. And it\u2019s totally homemade, with fresh, whole ingredients \u2014 just pasta and a few helpers. See how accommodating pasta can be? <br> This does take an hour to bake, but this time is totally hands-off; you can go do something else productive. The actual prep time for this is really very close to five minutes \u2014 especially if you aren\u2019t cooking chicken breasts specially for this recipe. I use frozen chopped chicken breasts or cooked chicken from the salad bar at the grocery store. <br> After that, this is just a matter of smashing garlic, opening up some diced tomatoes, and finding cheese and milk. The whole thing is topped off with a crunchy layer of green herbed breadcrumbs. <br> This recipe is very flexible; leave out the chicken if you want a vegetarian dish. You can skip the final breadcrumb topping, too, to save time, but I like the crunchy breadcrumbs; my husband thought they had the crumbly, chewy texture (and herb-y flavor) of browned sausage. It tops off the casserole very nicely. <br> When this first comes out of the oven it will be gooey and bubbling \u2014 saucy and a bit soupy. As it cools it will firm up and thicken. After a night in the fridge this is a solid pasta casserole, able to be cut in wedges. Personally, I like it best straight out of the oven, although it does make fantastic leftovers too. <br> This recipe truly blew my mind with its ease and deliciousness. While it takes oven time, your hands are free to prep a side dish, wash dishes, or get out of the kitchen completely. I found that the topping tasted like pesto since I used basil, and I realized that if you don\u2019t even have the time to make the topping, you can just mix purchased pesto with panko breadcrumbs for the same yummy result. <br> \u2013 <br>Christine<br>, January 2016<br> ",

        "<br> When I discovered that you can <br>make caramelized onions in the slow cooker<br> with no stirring and virtually no work, it was only a small step from there to French onion soup. Although I\u2019ve made this bistro favorite the <br>classic, Julia-inspired way<br>, now that I know how to make it in the slow cooker, I\u2019m probably never going back to stovetop! <br> Here\u2019s a step-by-step recipe for blissfully delicious French onion soup made from start to finish in the slow cooker. Well, right up until the cheesy toast. You still need the oven for that, but with soup this easy, what\u2019s a little broiling at the end? <br> This is one of those magical recipes that makes you say <br>Oh<br>, <br>can it be so easy? <br>And the answer to that, for once, is yes. Yes it can. <br> Here\u2019s how it goes: Throw a few pounds of sliced onions in the slow cooker overnight, or for 12 hours (you can slice them in your food processor if you really want to hurry this along). Cook until dark and jammy; you don\u2019t even need to stir. Pour in some broth and walk away again. Come back at dinnertime, ladle out soup, and broil with cheese and toast. <br> Perfect French onion soup, absolutely hands-off. This is why slow cookers exist, you guys. <br> This is a pretty quick and basic guide to making French onion soup. If you want a little more detail, like some of my favorite flavoring add-ins (star anise, cinnamon, rosemary), my opinions on the right ratio of cheese to soup, and other notes on the classic preparation, visit our main French onion soup tutorial. <br> <br>Get the recipe: <br>How To Make French Onion Soup<br> <br> ",

        "How To Make Beef Bone Broth on the Stove or in a Slow Cooker",
        "<br> In the last few years, bone broth has become a grocery store staple. While you could always find beef broth or stock in the soup aisle of your grocery store, it wasn\u2019t until recently that you could find bone broth being sold as well, let alone being served like a latt\u00e9 at the coffee counter. We have our wellness-minded, Paleo-eating friends to thank for reviving our love and admiration for this long-cooked homemade stock. Make no bones about it, bone broth is essentially a deeper, richer beef stock made by simmering collagen-rich beef bones until you end up with a rich, nutritious, and deeply savory broth. <br> It\u2019s the kind of thing that\u2019s perfect for sipping from a mug on a cold day, or for dressing up and turning into a hearty soup for dinner. Want to try making it yourself? Let\u2019s do it! <br> Bone broth truly has been around for centuries \u2014 every world cuisine has their own version. Historically, bone broth was sometimes used as a health tonic, a warm breakfast, a handy ingredient for family dinners, or all of the above. It can be made with beef bones, pork bones, chicken bones, or a mix of all of them. It can also be flavored simply, with just a handful of vegetables, or it can be spiffed up with ingredients like fresh ginger, lemongrass, fish sauce, and dried mushrooms. <br> This slow-simmered bone broth is surprisingly delicate in flavor, with a nice balance of umami savoriness and a pleasing, vegetal sweetness. While it\u2019s no panacea, <br>current research<br> shows it\u2019s full of good-for-you nutrients, amino acids, and minerals. You can certainly drink it straight (and you should, because it\u2019s tasty!), but you can also save it for making stews or casseroles, simmering grains, or using it in any manner of meals. You can use bone broth in any recipe that calls for chicken or beef stock. <br> The best bone broth uses a mix of different bones: large, nutrient-rich beef or pork bones, as well as some smaller meaty cuts so your broth has some flavor. I like to use a mix of big beef bones (saved from roasts or begged from the butcher), meaty short ribs or oxtails, and knuckle or neck bones. Those knuckle and neck bones have a lot of collagen, which give the broth body and rich flavor. <br> You can also mix in bones and meaty cuts from other animals. Throw in a ham bone or shank, leftover turkey bones, some chicken feet \u2014 use whatever mix of bones you find or that sounds appealing to you. <br> Roasting adds an extra depth of flavor and richness to the soup, plus it makes a beautiful dark-colored broth. Also, a broth made with a lot of bare bones, without much meat, can sometimes have a bit of a metallic or sour flavor, and roasting the bones helps prevent this flavor. <br> I usually do this in the oven, rather than on the stovetop, so I can do the entire batch at once. If there are a lot of caramelized bits on the pan after roasting, I deglaze it with a splash of water on the stovetop and pour the brown bits in with the cooking liquid. <br> My instructors at culinary school would always say, \u201cCook it until it\u2019s done.\u201d Never is this maxim more true than with bone broth. Don\u2019t go by the clock; go by your nose, your tastebuds, and the color of the broth. When it\u2019s done, the broth will be deeply savory and have a rich mahogany color. <br> In practical terms, cook your broth for at least 12 hours, then start checking it. I\u2019m usually satisfied with my broth at around the 24-hour mark, but you can keep simmering for days. The bones will eventually start to crumble when all their nutrients and proteins have been extracted \u2014 once you see this happening with the majority of your bones, you\u2019ve probably extracted as much goodness as you\u2019re going to get. <br> Cooking your broth for this long on the stove might make you raise your eyebrows and worry about fire hazards, but don\u2019t worry too much \u2014 we\u2019re talking about <br>very<br> low heat. You can leave the broth on a back burner or put it in the oven at low temperature and let it go overnight. If you need to leave the house and don\u2019t want to leave your oven on, you can also make bone broth in a slow cooker. Directions for that method are below. <br> You can also save yourself both worry and time by making bone broth in the pressure cooker. <br> <br>Get the recipe:<br> <br>How To Make Any Bone Broth in the Pressure Cooker<br> <br> So you\u2019ve got yourself a batch of bone broth \u2014 now what? It\u2019s fantastic on its own, sipped from a mug first thing in the morning or as an afternoon pick-me-up. You can also use bone broth to make a batch of pho or ramen, braise some beef, or make your favorite soup. <br> <br>Read more: <br>10 Delicious Ways to Turn Bone Broth into Dinner<br> <br> Over the last few years, we\u2019ve made this recipe again and again improving it here and there over time. We\u2019ve ditched the olive oil, celery, and bay, which sometimes made for a bitter broth. Rinsing, roasting, and then resting the bones, water, and vinegar are now essential, non-optional steps. You may also notice that the amounts are smaller \u2014 making for a batch of broth that more readily fits a standard Dutch oven or a 6-quart slow cooker. The results are still a richer, deeply flavored broth that is even thicker and more luxurious than before. <br>-Kitchn Team 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make Homemade Ricotta Cheese",
        "<br> Milk, lemon juice, and about a half-hour of your time \u2014 that\u2019s all you need to make a batch of fresh, creamy homemade ricotta. You\u2019re not going to believe how easy and foolproof this is! And trust me \u2014 once you make your own ricotta, it\u2019s hard to go back to the stuff from the tub. <br> When I say this only takes a half hour, I should clarify that most of that time is actually hands-off. You bring the milk almost to a simmer, add lemon juice or vinegar, and then let it sit while you work on the rest of dinner. Another 10 minutes or so goes into straining the curds, and then the ricotta is ready for your lasagna, pizza, or whatever delicious plans you have in store. <br> This process for making ricotta works best if you\u2019re using whole milk, although I\u2019ve had success with 2%. Just avoid skim or nonfat milk as there just isn\u2019t enough milk fat left in the milk to actually separate into curds and whey. Also avoid using ultra-high temperature (UHT) pasteurized milk, as this process changes the protein structure of the milk and prevents it from separating. Unfortunately, many organic milks are UHT pasteurized, so if organic ricotta is your aim, definitely check the carton before buying. <br> Homemade ricotta really does have better texture and flavor than anything I\u2019ve ever bought at the grocery store. I suspect that this is due in large part to the fact that it\u2019s freshly made. I like that I can control just how wet or dry the ricotta is simply by how long I let it drain \u2014 I like wetter, looser ricotta for things like pizzas, and drier, firmer ricotta for cannoli and other desserts. If you wrap the drained ricotta in cheese cloth and press it beneath a weighted plate in the refrigerator overnight, you can also make a simple ricotta salata, paneer, queso fresco, or other fresh farmers cheese. <br> I also like that I can make exactly the amount of ricotta that I need. I find that a half gallon of milk dependably makes about two cups of ricotta depending on how long I let it drain, and the recipe can be scaled up or down to fit my recipe. Of course, if and when I <br>do<br> have leftover ricotta, I know there are plenty of ways to <br>use up those last few dabs<br>! <br> Making ricotta yourself also gives you a bonus: the leftover whey. This whey is fantastic in baked goods \u2014 try using whey instead of water in your next batch of bread or pizza dough. So good. You can also use a few spoonfuls of whey to jump-start the lacto-fermentation process when making things like <br>sauerkraut<br> and <br>kvass<br>. <br> I should also add that this is a simplified method intended for making a quick batch of ricotta at home. Traditionally, ricotta is made by heating the whey leftover from other cheese-making projects (those made by using starter cultures and rennet) \u2014 if you have whey of this type, then by all means, you should try making traditional ricotta! <br> <br>For more information on cheese-making, I highly recommend taking a look at this book:<br> <br>Artisan Cheese Making at Home<br> by Mary Karlin<br> ",

        "How To Cook Perfect Salmon Fillets",
        "<br> When it comes to simple, quick-cooking weeknight meals, salmon fillets always have a place in my regular lineup. This foolproof technique delivers a perfect medium-cooked fillet that\u2019s tender and flaky with deliciously crispy pan-seared skin. <br> When cooking salmon in the oven or on the grill, one large piece of fish works well. But when pan-searing on the stovetop, opt for individual fillets. One six- to eight-ounce fillet per person is a good amount. And if you\u2019re buying multiple fillets, don\u2019t be afraid to ask your fishmonger to portion them for you. <br> <br>Don\u2019t fall for these myths:<br> <br>3 Common Myths About Buying Salmon You Need to Know<br> <br> While it\u2019s certainly not the only way, we prefer sticking with a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet when cooking pan-seared salmon; make sure it\u2019s a pan that\u2019s large and wide enough to accommodate the fillets without overcrowding. And because the best results happen when the fish is cooked on a super-hot surface, it\u2019s best to skip the nonstick cookware this time around. <br> The very best thing about pan-seared salmon (in addition to a no-fuss process and super-quick cook time) is the skin. When cooked any other way, fish skin is, well, kind of unappetizing. But when a fillet is perfectly pan-seared, it\u2019s a totally different story. The skin cooks up to be super crispy; it\u2019s thin, brittle, and savory, in a way that\u2019s kind of on par with really good potato chips or bacon. Follow these three rules and you\u2019ll be rewarded with perfectly crispy skin every single time. <br> While the salmon will cook on both sides, the process should always start by adding the fish to the pan skin-side down. The skin is tough and durable, and can withstand more time on the hot surface of the pan without overcooking. <br> This is arguably the hardest part of cooking pan-seared salmon. Once the fish hits the pan, the very best course of action is to step away (but not too far) and let it do its thing. It might take some serious willpower, but you need to trust the process \u2014 no touching, no poking or prodding, and no moving the fillet around. You\u2019ll be tempted to lift the fish or move it around the pan to see how it\u2019s coming along, but the very best thing you can do is to keep your hands off and wait. <br> When pan-searing, the bulk of the cooking takes place while the salmon is skin-side down. After it\u2019s been cooking for a few minutes, you\u2019ll start to notice the color of the fillet slowly begin to change. Starting from the bottom, where the skin touches the pan, and working its way upward along the sides of the fillets, you\u2019ll see the flesh lighten from deep, dark pink to a much more pale color. <br> This change in the color of the flesh will act as your indicator for how the cooking is progressing. Once the color change has moved up about three-quarters of the way from the bottom, it\u2019s time to flip. Since the bulk of cooking has already happened, the salmon will cook for a couple minutes more after flipping it flesh-side down. What you\u2019ll get is a tender and flaky piece of salmon, cooked perfectly to medium, with super-crispy skin. ",

Above all else, resist the temptation to poke, prod, or move the fish; it's important that you leave it be. As the fish cooks, you'll notice the color of the fillet begin to lighten, starting at the bottom near the skin and slowly moving upwards. Cook the salmon undisturbed until the lighter-colored flesh has moved about 3/4 of the way up the fillets.

        "How To Make the Best Chocolate Avocado Pudding",
        "<br> Creamy, smooth, sweet, and satisfying, chocolate pudding is a treat that always invites a smile. One version of chocolate pudding has been rising in popularity for the past few years, and it\u2019s with very good reason. As the interest in plant-based food increases, the seismic shift from boxed mixes or stovetop versions found their hero in naturally creamy avocado. <br> This chocolate avocado pudding is as chocolatey and luscious as any other pudding, and it\u2019s even richer-tasting, more unctuous, and even more chocolatey. Best of all it\u2019s vegan and gluten-free. Unlike the other versions, which can taste milky or ultra-sweet, this chocolate avocado pudding is all about the chocolate. <br> Now, I don\u2019t make that claim lightly. This is the best version of chocolate avocado pudding that I have ever made or eaten because it is so well-balanced and multidimensional, thanks to a series of choices we made along the way. <br> Perhaps one of the nicest things about chocolate avocado pudding is how well it adapts to all sorts of dietary needs. It starts out gluten-, dairy-, and egg-free, so it\u2019s already quite a versatile winner. <br> If you are a vegan, skip the honey and the rest of the recipe is ready for you. <br> If you follow a Paleo diet, try raw honey and maple syrup as the sweeteners, stick to plain almond milk that has no added sugar, and use an unsweetened chocolate. You may find that you need to double the amount of sweetener called for in the recipe since the chocolate and cocoa are both a bit bitter. Start with 1/3 cup and add a tablespoon at a time, mixing it in fully after each addition and tasting each time, until the pudding is the just sweetness level you prefer. <br> I would avoid stevia, molasses, chicory root, and inulin fiber in this recipe because they have bitter undertones that throw off the balance or overtake the key chocolate flavor. If you have a <br>vanilla bean<br> and a few minutes, try adding the seeds to the mixture in lieu of the extract, for a bigger flavor punch. Make sure to check with your Paleo plan about what you can use. <br> If you follow a Whole30 plan, opt for a nut milk with no added sugar or carrageenan, use the date syrup (or 6 to 8 pitted moist dates, and make sure to get them completely mixed in). <br> The challenge here is the chocolate. Unsweetened chocolate can be used, but just like with Paleo, you might have to adjust the sugar called for in the recipe, since the chocolate and cocoa are both a bit bitter. Dark chocolate, which has sugar in it, is not on the Whole30 plan, but unsweetened chocolate might or might not be acceptable. <br> Some adherents argue that since the underlying premise of the program is to teach yourself to be satiated without sweets, this pudding and chocolate or even cocoa are problematic. Make sure to check with your Whole30 plan about what you can use. <br> You can make this pudding as thin or thick as you like, as well. If you want to thicken the pudding, add one to three tablespoons of coconut cream, melted coconut butter, or even half of a very ripe banana. To thin it down, add more of your chosen milk. <br> Chocolate avocado pudding is a versatile natural treat that can satisfy so many in a single, simple dish. From toddlers to the elderly, and dieters to splurgers, it always satisfies with gracious ease. <br> Now that\u2019s what I call delicious. ",

        "How To Braise Beef Short Ribs in a Dutch Oven",
        "<br> Short ribs are the quintessential caveman cut, straight out of Fred Flinstone\u2019s larder, with their hunks of rich meat on the bone, looking primal and carnivore-ready. They\u2019re a rich winter meal, too, easy and forgiving to cook under their sleek caps of fat, melting into tender chunks of pull-apart beef in the oven. <br> If you\u2019re feeling like a hibernating caveman and want a delicious, comforting, beefy meal, here\u2019s a step-by-step recipe to help you take short ribs and turn them into a dinner with almost no work. Hunting not required. <br> In the past, short ribs have been a favorite meal of mine for another reason, besides their incredibly rich taste: they are inexpensive. Well, that may have changed a bit in the last few years. This formerly cheap cut, found with the stew beef and other tough braising meats, has become so trendy and spotlighted that prices (at least in my grocery stores) have risen accordingly. Have you noticed this too? <br> But they\u2019re still a deal compared to a steak or tenderloin, and perhaps your butcher isn\u2019t as sensitive to trends. The tradeoff in this price hike is that it\u2019s easier to find them. A few years ago I would always have to ask at the butcher counter for short ribs; these days I often find them in the meat case with other cuts of beef. <br> I usually buy short ribs with the bone still attached, which is cheaper. The more expensive boneless cuts are convenient, though, and easier for serving, but I think the bone adds flavor in cooking, too. Sometimes the short ribs will be chopped into short chunks, with one or two bones apiece. It really doesn\u2019t matter either way since the meat is going to fall off the bone after it is cooked, and the meat becomes so tender that it\u2019s easy to separate into individual servings. <br> This method is very straightforward \u2014 it\u2019s the way that I nearly always cook short ribs. Season and brown the ribs, then add some onion and aromatics plus liquid to the pot, and cook low and slow. It\u2019s Braising 101. <br> For the low and slow step, I prefer the oven as it is more forgiving (no checking to make sure the bottom doesn\u2019t scorch) and I think it cooks more evenly. <br> However, you can also do these in the slow cooker or on the stovetop \u2014 just refer to the instructions at the end of the recipe below. <br> Short ribs usually come with quite a bit of fat, and while you can trim some of this off before cooking I prefer not to, since it insulates the meat and keeps it moist and tender while cooking. <br> But all that fat, melted off during cooking, can give a pronounced greasy feel to the meat. So I prefer to chill short ribs overnight and remove the chilled fat before reheating and serving. They reheat easily on the stove or in the oven and usually taste even better with this overnight rest. <br> This step is also why I think short ribs are such a convenient dinner party dish! You can do all the work the day before then just reheat and serve. <br> Want more smart tutorials for getting things done around the kitchen?<br> <br>See more How To posts<br> We\u2019re looking for great examples of your own household intelligence too! <br> <br>Submit your own tutorials or ideas here!<br> ",

        "Recipe: Baked Mushroom Risotto with Caramelized Onions",
        "<br> Looking for something cozy, warm, and rich for dinner tonight? Here\u2019s a recipe adapted from my book, <br>Not Your Mother\u2019s Casseroles<br> \u2014 a creamy, thick, baked rice dish full of dark mushroom flavor. Topped with sweet caramelized onions and a flurry of pepper, it\u2019s one of the most satisfying things to eat when you\u2019re craving savory comfort food. <br> Risotto is known as a laborious stovetop dish, requiring up to an hour of constant stirring to achieve the perfect consistency of distinct, tender rice grains suspended in a creamy sauce. (There\u2019s not usually actual <br>cream<br> in risotto, unless it\u2019s dashed in at the end; the creaminess comes from the starch of the rice itself.) <br> So can a much simpler, more hands-off baked risotto simulate this effect? Well, not exactly. You won\u2019t have that perfect, idealized texture, but you\u2019ll still have something very, very good. This dish has soft, tender grains of rice, thick and creamy and warm. It doesn\u2019t turn to mush, though \u2014 this is still not a half-bad risotto, however unorthodox its preparation may be. And it is much more convenient; you have to do some cooking before putting the dish in the oven, but then you\u2019re free to make caramelized onions, finish your salad, and set the table while it bakes. <br> And yes, this version is fully vegan too. It\u2019s an especially great dish to make for a mixed dinner party of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans. It\u2019s so good on its own that the omnivores will never miss the meat. <br> But they and the vegetarians can spoon a little mascarpone or sour cream into their dishes for an extra hint of creaminess, while the vegans can use Tofutti\u2019s Better than Cream Cheese. I have a lot of people in my life who need to eat dairy-free, and while I usually avoid dairy substitutes, I appreciate that sometimes it\u2019s just really nice to have something creamy. And I personally love the Tofutti products. <br> But neither of those additions are necessary \u2014 this dish is perfect winter comfort food all on its own. <br> Risotto is easily one of my favorite dishes to cook at home, but I\u2019ve actually never tried a baked version. While I am the odd duck who finds stirring classic risotto on the stovetop soothing, I really did love the ease of this baked variation. The dried mushrooms, along with their rehydrating liquid and a splash of balsamic, lend such deep flavor to the dish. It\u2019s a vegan recipe, sure, but that depth makes it universally appealing, which means it\u2019s guaranteed to please a mixed group of eaters \u2014 omnivores and carnivores, too. It\u2019s so rich and flavorful, it doesn\u2019t really need much more of a garnish besides the caramelized onions, but as Faith suggests, a dollop of sour cream or mascarpone, if you\u2019re not vegan, or a dollop of <br>cashew cream<br> or <br>Tofutti cream cheese<br>, if you are, will gild the lily. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, February 2018<br> ",

Let them go as long as you can; I usually cook mine for at least 30 minutes.",

        "How To Make Chewy Brownies",
        "<br> How do you like your brownies? They tend to fall into three major categories, with their own diehard fans: cakey, fudgy, or chewy. All have their advantages (the dense richness of brownies that are closer to fudge than any baked good; the lightness and flavor of ones that run closer to cake). But chewy brownies \u2014 just this side of gooey, with a crackled, shiny crust \u2014 are perhaps the most ardently adored. <br> Here is our own step-by-step recipe for super-chewy brownies, with gorgeous tops and a rich center. They\u2019re so much better than the box, and you only need one pan to whip them up. Brownies await! <br> These brownies ride the line between chewiness and the rich experience of dark, fudgy brownies because we really just don\u2019t want to compromise on the chocolate or the flavor. The absolute chewiest brownies use unsaturated oils, like canola (<br>Cook\u2019s Illustrated <br>has a comprehensive guide to why this is so). But we find that brownies made with oil just don\u2019t taste as good as those made with butter. <br> But oil isn\u2019t the only key to a chewy brownie: Using dark brown sugar helps create that texture. Mixing in some white sugar gives you the shiny tops. <br> However, the best touch for the chewy brownie experience comes at the very end. Chewy brownies <br>must<br> be slightly underbaked; if you over-bake them you will lose out on that chewiness you want. Secondly, put these in the fridge for an hour after baking for the ultimate chewy texture. Yes, it\u2019s torture to wait an hour when you\u2019ve been smelling the fine aroma of baking brownies. (Sneak a corner to tide you over.) But chilling the slightly underbaked brownies will give you reliably chewy results every single time. ",

        "<br> Are you cooking something sweet for Valentine\u2019s Day? We asked our readers on <br>Twitter<br> and <br>Facebook<br> if there was anything they hoped to attempt for the first time this year, and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e came up. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is such an astonishingly easy treat, and I was happy for the excuse to revisit it. <br> Here\u2019s a recipe and step-by-step guide to making cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in your own kitchen \u2014 no torch or special equipment required, and you\u2019ll only need five or six ingredients to get that sweet, creamy custard with a shattering sugar crust. <br> Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is really one of the simplest desserts to make. But like <br>French onion soup<br>, it seems to be a dessert that many people don\u2019t realize they can make at home. It\u2019s such a staple of restaurants \u2014 it must be finicky and difficult, right? Nope! There\u2019s no stovetop stirring, no need for a mixer. There are no specialty ingredients or tools involved. <br> All you do is mix up a few egg yolks with cream and a little sugar. Bake, then chill and broil with sugar on top. <br> Some cooks use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar on top of the custard, but why buy a gadget for this one use? Okay, some of us like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e <br>a lot<br>, and maybe if you\u2019re making it every week it\u2019s worth it to buy a torch. But honestly, the oven broiler will do a fine job. I follow Alton Brown\u2019s advice of putting the ramekins in a cold oven, then turning on the broiler. This helps keep the custard cool while getting the top crisp. <br> <br>Using a kitchen torch instead of a broiler? <br> Getting a Good Caramelized Top on Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e<br> <br> An oven-broiled cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tends to be a little more rustic, spattered with craters of burnt sugar, blackened around the edges, with piebald pale spots here and there. I do not mind this. In fact, I like my cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e just this side of burnt; I think that such a sweet, rich custard needs the dark, nearly bitter burnt sugar to balance it out. So here you are: cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Happy tap, tap, tapping! ",

        "How To Make Red Beans & Rice in an Electric Pressure Cooker",
        "<br> \u201cRed beans and rice on Monday\u201d is one of the dependable workday cornerstones of New Orleans cuisine, a hearty dish rooted in the city\u2019s 300-year history. Originally an ingenious, low-maintenance way to feed a house on pre-machine laundry day, \u201cred beans and rice\u201d worked its way into classic status through the region\u2019s home, restaurant, and lunchroom menus. <br> As luck would have it, when I moved to New Orleans in 2001, I was looking for a way to feed a bunch of folks. A new transplant to the city, I had inherited my grandmother\u2019s kitchen table \u2014 a hulking, Formica-topped chunk of maple that served as one of the centers of our family\u2019s emotional universe. Two generations of my mama\u2019s family grew up around that table, so filling it once a week with clatter and food seemed like the right thing to do. <br> I adapted the Monday-night red beans tradition and filled the table with an ever-changing group of pals, family, friends-of-friends, travelers, and other ne\u2019er-do-wells. In 15 years, it\u2019s never been the same group twice, yet the conversations and energy help propel us through the week. <br> Simple food, simple rules \u2014 red beans and cornbread on the menu, come casual, bring whatchawannadrink, no phones at the table, whiskey for dessert \u2014 works every time on a typically odious Monday night. Everybody wants to eat hearty and drink wine after a day back at work. The magic is in the simplicity and the kismet of the big table. <br> After a while, visiting guests started asking for a version in their hometowns (\u201cYou wanna come up and do it at my place?\u201d). Friends in the restaurant business (many of them chefs who worked in New Orleans or loved the city) volunteered their spaces, and the <br>Red Beans Roadshow<br> took to the road in 2015. <br> It\u2019s all focused on the same elemental ritual: good food, good conversation, and minimal distractions. It\u2019s a chance to share a laugh over a bowl of red beans and share a little bit of New Orleans before Tuesday morning rolls around. <br> Here\u2019s how to bring it to your home. <br> In such a simple dish, the right bean (and in this case, there <br>is<br> a correct choice) can make all the difference. For decades, New Orleans grandmothers consistently used dried kidney beans marked with a big red blossom \u2014 <br>Camellia Brand<br> \u2014 as their go-to brand. <br> \u201cCamellias\u201d inspire fierce loyalty among traditional New Orleans cooks because of their famously high standards (the Camellia family has an FDS \u201cbetter than A\u201d grade named after them), consistent flavor profile, and affordability. And because <br>everybody<br> buys them, store inventories cycle through frequently, eliminating the bane of the dried-bean cook \u2014 old, stale beans that never quite \u201ccream out\u201d and stay crunchy even after hours of cooking. <br> <br>Camellia beans are available in select grocery stores, through online outlets like <br>Amazon<br>, or via the <br>company\u2019s website<br>. <br> Although a meaty hambone is the traditional way to add porky goodness to the dish, I usually turn to andouille from <br>Jacob\u2019s World Famous Andouille<br> in Laplace, Louisiana, just outside New Orleans. Jacob\u2019s makes their distinctive andouille in the traditional style \u2014 chunks of pork shoulder simply spiced with salt, peppers, cayenne, and garlic and then smoked for hours over oak or pecan wood. This technique makes for an amazingly flavorful, chunky sausage that\u2019s like the spicy core of God\u2019s own Easter ham. <br> <br> Pro tip<br>: If you can only get mushy emulsified \u201candouille\u201d from your local grocery, it\u2019s best to substitute a diced ham or an aggressive kielbasa. Most grocery store sausages are basically hot dogs with Cajun spices added. <br> And speaking of \u201cCajun spices,\u201d just about every Louisiana cook uses a pre-mixed seasoning blend to build layers of flavor during the initial aromatic saut\u00e9 of the \u201cHoly Trinity\u201d \u2014 onion, green bell pepper, celery \u2014 and garlic. There are tons of varieties of Louisiana/Cajun/Creole seasonings available in the modern grocery world, but my go-to has always been <br>Tony Chachere\u2019s<br> (pronounced SHASH-er-eez), a staple in most southern Louisiana home kitchens. <br> Pableaux cooks his red beans in a simple slow-simmering stovetop method, which is ideal for perfuming the house on a Monday evening. We\u2019ve adapted it for faster cooking in an electric pressure cooker. Less romantic, perhaps, but the pressure cooker allows for enjoying this traditional New Orleans dish even on the most hurried Monday evenings. ",

        "<br> These swing of the weather can be really confusing for a cook. On the one hand, we\u2019re psyched for salads and iced coffee, but then there are days when it\u2019s pouring rain and you\u2019re freezing. Enter: coq au vin (chicken stewed in wine). <br> On those chilly days, I scour my pantry for enough of the ingredients to make a dish that passes for a classic coq au vin \u2014 chicken thighs, dried porcini mushrooms, a red onion, pancetta, and red wine. What I didn\u2019t have was time. <br> Is it the French name that makes people, myself included, think the dish is going to take all day? It won\u2019t. Although some time is usually taken up doing things like blanching the bacon, skimming the fat, and reducing the sauce, I pushed things a bit. In just over 30 minutes dinner was served. Much of that time is when the dish is simmering, so you can set the table, start a load of laundry, read a New Yorker article, or just stare into space. <br> Imagine: Coq au vin could be your new weeknight go-to meal. <br> It is possible to make this dish with any part of the chicken; I like the thighs because they are succulent and nestle into a pot nicely. If you have fresh mushrooms and want to make a super-classic version of the dish, add them to the sauce before reducing, just as the recipe is written for the dried mushrooms. Pearl onions are what you\u2019ll usually find in coq au vin, but they require a few extra steps, so for something equally tasty and not nearly as laborious, use any standard onion or a few shallots. <br> Coq au vin is usually served over wide egg noodles, but I like it with a few hunks of baguette and good butter. Roasted potatoes also make a good side dish. <br> One of the very first dinner party dishes I cooked was coq au vin \u2014 albeit it was for my family in my parent\u2019s house while I was in high school. It took the better part of the evening and skimping on my homework to make, but I\u2019ll never forgot how proud I felt pulling it out of the oven to serve. <br> This version takes a whole lot of the legwork out of the equation and transforms it into a weeknight dinner that couldn\u2019t be easier to pull off \u2014 I wish I had found this recipe in high school! Even though the technique is simplified, the results are nearly the same as the traditional version. It\u2019s a meal that\u2019s so comforting and feels ridiculously fast and fancy. While it can be served over egg noodles or mashed potatoes, I love letting it shine all on its own, with nothing but crusty bread on the side to soak up the sauce. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, February 2018<br> ",

        "How To Make a King Cake for Mardi Gras",
        "<br> King cakes are made around the world as part of the festival of the Epiphany, but in New Orleans, king cakes have truly taken on a life of their own. From the start of Carnival on January 6 through Mardi Gras at the beginning of February, you\u2019ll find one of these sweet, color-splashed king cakes in just about every office break room and at every family gathering. <br> Did you get \u201cthe baby\u201d? That means you bring the next cake \u2014 and we have just the cake you\u2019ll want to bring. <br> King cakes are named for the Three Kings of the Bible and were part of the Epiphany celebration at the end of the 12 Days of Christmas. They\u2019re variously called <br>Galette des Rois <br>in France, <br>Rosca de Reyes<br> in Spain, and <br>vasilopita<br> in Greece. <br> I spoke with Judy Walker, retired food editor for the New Orlean\u2019s Times-Picayune and author of <br>Cooking Up a Storm<br>, about how the king cake tradition has taken shape in Louisiana. She told me that it was originally brought to the area by French settlers, but it wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that the cakes really took firm hold. Two local bakeries, McKenzie\u2019s and Gambino\u2019s, were key in establishing the cultural significance of the king cakes. They started selling their versions of king cake during Carnival season, and the popularity just skyrocketed. Walker told me that king cakes from New Orleans\u2019 bakeries are now shipped all over the world, and it\u2019s become a major industry in the area. <br> Traditionally, the \u201cbaby\u201d was actually a small dried bean or a pecan, which would get baked right into the cake. Finding the bean in your slice of cake means that you got to be king or queen for the day and are also responsible for bringing the next cake to keep the party going. (If you\u2019re in New Orleans, don\u2019t overlook this etiquette of bringing the next cake or you may find yourself with grumpy co-workers!) <br> Since then, the bean has morphed into an actual toy baby figurine \u2014 although Walker was quick to stop me when I mused that this must represent the baby Jesus. She said that all sorts of trinkets have been used in king cakes, and the baby figurine is just one that caught on particularly well. <br> <br>Read more: <br>Mardi Gras: Does That King Cake Baby Represent the Baby Jesus?<br> by Judy Walker for The Times-Picayune <br> New Orleans king cakes take after the Southern French tradition of a ring-shaped cake made with a rich yeasted bread similar to brioche, but as Walker explained to me, there is a lot of room for the individual baker\u2019s tastes and interpretation. Yes, the very original king cakes were fairly plain yeasted loaves, included no filling, and were barely sweet, but they have evolved with the times and with people\u2019s tastes. <br> These days, you can find \u2014 or make! \u2014 king cakes that are filled or unfilled, shaped in a plain circle or twisted into a braid, and topped with plain icing or covered with glittering sprinkles on every surface. The most popular versions are stuffed with a cream cheese filling or with a cinnamon filling, but Walker also talked about seeing king cakes filled with everything from pecan praline to goat cheese and apples. Walker says, \u201cPeople like their own styles and often have loyalties to a particular bakery.\u201d <br> The particular king cake that I made for this recipe is adapted from Walker\u2019s own recipe in <br>Cooking Up a Storm<br>. I took her advice on the filling and stuck with cinnamon and sugar \u2014 my favorite \u2014 and rolled it up like one giant cinnamon roll. I love the pretty spiraled layers this makes. If you\u2019d like a more sweet and doughy bread with less filling than we\u2019ve made here, just roll your dough more thinly and make fewer rolls. ",

        "<br> I love everything about chocolate-covered strawberries. I love the crunchy, melt-in-your-mouth shell and the cool, sweet strawberry beneath. I love giving them as presents, and I love receiving them equally as much. And I especially love how easy they are to make at home \u2014 it\u2019s an afternoon project with a result that looks fancy no matter your candy-making skills (or lack thereof)! <br> With a project as simple as this \u2014 \u201ctake strawberry, dip in chocolate\u201d \u2014 the ingredients you use can really make a difference. You can certainly do this with your average bag of chocolate chips and basket of grocery store strawberries, and in fact, that\u2019s a great idea for a rainy day project with kids. But if you really want to up the ante, spring for the fancy chocolate and pick up some super-ripe farmers market strawberries. It will really make a difference. <br> The only other trick to making chocolate-covered strawberries is that <br>the<br> <br>strawberries must be very, very dry.<br> If you have any water left from rinsing or any sticky bruised areas, the coating doesn\u2019t \u201cstick\u201d to the strawberry as well. Drops of water can also make your chocolate seize up and become grainy as you dip. After rinsing the strawberries, I recommend patting them dry and then laying them out on a clean dish towel until they are completely dry. <br> While none of the techniques used here are overly complicated, here\u2019s a little more information about some of them if you\u2019d like the extra help! <br> Chocolate-dipped strawberries look their best and are their snappiest the day they are made. You can store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Lining the bottom of the container with a clean paper towel will help wick away moisture for storage. Don\u2019t expect stored chocolate strawberries to look as shiny as freshly dipped and set berries. ",

        "How To Make Classic French Palmiers",
        "<br> Elegant palmiers made from puff pastry are one of my all-time favorite treats. I just love the crunch of the sugar with the crunch of the pastry, and the way the flaky, buttery layers practically melt on the tongue. It feels so fancy to put them on a cookie tray for a spot of afternoon tea. <br> I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret, though: Despite their impressive nature, these cookies are super easy to make. <br> Palmiers are made with nothing more than a sheet of puff pastry and some sugar. If you\u2019ve made yourself some <br>homemade puff pastry<br>, palmiers are an excellent way to show off your baking skills. Store-bought puff pastry works just as well, but be sure to buy one made entirely with butter. Since this cookie is so simple, using puff pastry made with shortening or other oils just won\u2019t taste as good. <br> For the sugar, I use demerara or another coarse-grained sugar. I love the crunch and flavor of these specialty sugars. Brown sugar or granulated sugar also work just fine and make a sweeter palmier. There are also no rules that say you can\u2019t mix a few different sugars together. <br> Classically, palmiers are made by folding the left and right sides of the pastry to the middle, then folding the dough in half again length-wise, sandwiching the first folds inside. Sliced into individual cookies, this is what gives the palmiers their distinctive \u201cpalm\u201d or elephant-ear shape. <br> You can also roll the sides of the puff pastry toward the middle, making even more layers and giving the palmiers a more rounded look. <br> Sugar-filled palmiers are classic, but by all means, don\u2019t stop there! You can mix cinnamon or other baking spices with the sugar, or add minced pieces of crystallized ginger or lemon peel. Dried, chopped fruits, like currants or cranberries, could also make their way into these cookies. <br> On the savory side, give your last few scoops of pesto or tapenade a second life as a filling in a batch of palmiers. I also like filling the palmiers with a mix of shredded cheeses. These savory palmiers make great appetizers for dinner parties. ",

        "<br> Ah, couscous! The food so nice they named it twice. Except this isn\u2019t really couscous. <br>It\u2019s cauliflower<br>. And I feel like I won a gold medal in the kitchen when my couscous-loving husband didn\u2019t bat an eye while he gobbled up this \u201cpretend\u201d version. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I don\u2019t usually like when food is referred to something it\u2019s not. However, the texture is so close to the real deal you won\u2019t miss a beat and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t know what else to call it! <br> Cauliflower is one of my favorite vegetables we grow on <br>our farm<br>. We are still a few weeks out until our cauliflower is ready, but other farms in our valley are already harvesting this lovely brassica and I was really excited to get my hands on some! <br> Cauliflower is so tender in the spring that it seems silly to toss it in the oven. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 roasted cauliflower is one of my favorite side dishes and despite what I just said, I\u2019ll probably end up roasting some very soon. However, right now I\u2019m enjoying as many vegetables as I can in their most pure state. <br> The Mediterranean flavors really shine in this simple spring salad and the roasted chickpeas add a lovely crunch. Grab a fork and dig in! Cauliflower \u201ccouscous\u201d is a winner in our household and I hope you all enjoy it as much as we do. ",

        "How To Make Panna Cotta",
        "<br> Last year I made an ardent case for <br>panna cotta as the perfect dessert<br>: it\u2019s easy, quick, practically foolproof, and accommodating to many dietary adjustments, being naturally gluten-free and adaptable to dairy-free and vegan diets. <br> Now that I\u2019ve made my case for the merits of this lovely dessert, let\u2019s move on and talk about how luscious it is, how perfectly creamy, in a way that belies its utter simplicity. And let me walk you through making panna cotta, step by step. <br> Once during our editorial retreat, I made panna cotta for a dinner at home, and insisted to <br>Ariel<br>, our engagement editor, that it was a piece of cake to make. No, actually \u2014 <br>easier<br> than cake. (Har har.) She went home and tried a recipe from my book, <br>Bakeless Sweets<br>, and reported back, wide-eyed, that she couldn\u2019t believe how easy and quick it was. <br> I find that\u2019s usually the case with panna cotta; people think it\u2019s some laborious restaurant dessert involving cheesecloth and a chinois, but it\u2019s actually easier than making Jell-O out of a box. <br> But there I go again about how easy this is. Let\u2019s get back to how it tastes, shall we? <br> Panna cotta is a very basic pudding that is made of dairy thickened with gelatin. It originated in Italy and its name literally means \u201ccooked cream,\u201d since the earliest versions were made of thick cream, sometimes thickened with fish bones. <br> You can eat it straight out of a cup, but it\u2019s often unmolded onto a plate and drizzled with sweet sauce and garnished with fruit. A bite of panna cotta is remarkably creamy, melting in the mouth without a trace of grittiness or lumps. <br> This tutorial will teach you how to make the most basic vanilla panna cotta, flavored with vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. You only need a few ingredients (milk, cream, gelatin, flavorings). I often don\u2019t even use milk and cream, but half-and-half (see my note on that below). The goal with panna cotta is to calibrate the amount of gelatin to the dairy and its fat so you achieve a firm set that is still delicate and wobbly. <br> Like with any other elemental recipe, you could argue for days over the pieces. You might like your panna cotta a touch sweeter, or with less fat in it. I think that Russ Parsons laid out the basics of what can be adjusted in panna cotta very well here. <br> <br>Read more: <br>3 Keys to Perfect Panna Cotta<br> <br>by Russ Parsons <br> This recipe is my own idea of a very good basic panna cotta. It\u2019s not too fatty, and not too sweet, but still rich. I included a touch of extra gelatin to make it extra-foolproof, and so that you can unmold it onto a plate. But it shouldn\u2019t be rubbery \u2014 it\u2019s wobbly and velvety smooth. <br> For this recipe you should use plain, unflavored gelatin, which is usually found in the grocery store aisle with the baking supplies and Jell-O. I use granulated gelatin, which is the most common form of gelatin in the U.S. (as opposed to gelatin sheets). <br> <br>What if you don\u2019t eat gelatin?<br> Gelatin is an animal product and not vegetarian. You can substitute agar agar or another vegetarian gelatin substitute. I don\u2019t give precise substitutions because if you\u2019re using a vegetarian gelatin, you may also be switching up the milk and cream for an alternative dairy, and I haven\u2019t tested the permutations of agar agar with soy, coconut, or almond milk, or in all the various combinations. At some point in the near future I\u2019ll bring you a completely vegan panna cotta recipe! <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>Gelling Without Gelatin: Vegetarian and Vegan Substitutes<br> <br> Now, shall we make some pudding? This is a lot of conversation for what ends up being about five minutes at the stove \u2014 it\u2019s so easy! Oops, there I go again. Let\u2019s get started! <br> <br> <br> <br> Panna cotta is such an easy dessert to make, and finishing it off can be very simple too. Here are a few ways I like to serve it. ",

            " Fill a large bowl partway with warm to hot water. Wipe a dessert plate with a damp paper towel (a damp plate lets you reposition the panna cotta more easily if it doesn't fall in the right spot).",
            "Release the panna cotta edge from the cup:",
            " Run a thin knife carefully around the sides of a ramekin. Don't slide the knife all the way into the cup; just release the top edge of the pudding from the edge of the cup. Dip the ramekin in the warm water up to its rim, and hold it there for about 3 seconds.",
            "Unmold on a plate:",
            " Invert the ramekin over the plate and shake gently to help the panna cotta fall out, or press gently on one side to help nudge it out. It should fall out on the plate easily. (If it does not, return to the warm water bath in increments of 2 seconds.) Reposition on the plate if desired. Serve immediately, or refrigerate, lightly covered, for up to 5 days. The gelatin gets stronger as it sits, so this will be a bit rubbery by days 4 or 5, but you can mitigate this by letting the panna cotta sit at room temperature for about half an hour before serving."

It\u2019s already basically the most <br>amazing<br> substance <br>known<br> to <br>humankind<br>, and now you tell me I can mix Nutella with just one ingredient to make a batch of fudgy, chewy brownies? <br> I know \u2014 if I hadn\u2019t tried it myself, I wouldn\u2019t believe me either. But here\u2019s exactly how you, too, can make these magical two-ingredient brownies for yourself. <br> I\u2019ve come across other Nutella brownies using three or four ingredients \u2014 like these from <br>Kirbie\u2019s Cravings<br> or these from <br>Cup of Jo<br> \u2014 but what <br>really<br> piqued my curiosity was the idea of brownies made with just two ingredients, like the ones I spotted from Kate over on <br>Tasty Kitchen<br>, another recipe from <br>Kirbie Cravings<br>, and in this hilarious cooking video from <br>The Virgin Kitchen<br>. <br> These brownies are made with just a cup of Nutella and four large eggs. That\u2019s it. They\u2019re gluten-free, incredibly easy, and absolutely perfect for a crowd. They have a fudgy, silky texture; a crispy wafer top; and deep chocolate flavor that defies all logic. <br> How does this work? I have no idea. It\u2019s magic. <br> What I <br>do<br> know is the key to success with these brownies is whisking the eggs until they\u2019re light lemon-colored, frothy, and tripled in bulk. This is what leavens your brownies and keeps you from making an eggy, chocolate-flavored mess. Whisk those eggs like you mean it! Keep whisking! Use a stand mixer or a hand mixer! Trust! <br> I like making these as brownies for an easy weeknight dessert, but I\u2019m also keeping this recipe in my back pocket for the next time I want a flourless chocolate cake. Just imagine it sprinkled with powdered sugar, topped with fresh fruit, and drizzled with chocolate sauce \u2014 serious dinner party <br>win<br>, right there. <br> Enough talk. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to make your own batch, complete with step-by-step pictures of how everything should look! ",

        "<br> Okay, we\u2019re not going to win any awards for thinking up this combination, but hey \u2014 these potato bites are easy, delicious, and perfect for a sports-loving crowd, should you find yourself surrounded by one this weekend. They even remind us of sports-bar food, like little deconstructed potato skins. <br> We decided to make these after countless evenings munching on <br>these bacon-wrapped dates<br>, which are also very yummy, but got us thinking about other things we could wrap in bacon. Potatoes? Potatoes could be perfect. And cheap. <br> If you can find tiny new potatoes, those would be even more aesthetically precious. But chunks work fine, too; just be sure to dice the potatoes smaller than you might think. We found that the smaller chunks actually had a better potato-to-bacon ratio. They were dangerously poppable. <br> With the creamy wedge of potato and the crunchy bacon, the sour cream dip is what pushes this appetizer over the edge. Again, mixing some hot sauce into the sour cream is a no-brainer, and yet that\u2019s exactly what makes the dip addictive. If you swirl the hot sauce into the sour cream instead of fully mixing it in, you\u2019ll get a roulette of spicy and cool bites. Hold on to your hats! ",

        "<br> I\u2019ve been experimenting a lot with vegetable patties recently since they\u2019re an easy way to pack nutrient-rich ingredients together. Their small, portable size also makes them easy to stuff into pitas, pack into my daughter\u2019s lunches, or even top with a fried egg for a savory breakfast. The latest winning combination? Sweet potato and chickpea. <br> Lots of sweet potato patty or burger recipes start with mashed, cooked sweet potato. Sounds delicious, but I don\u2019t always have cooked sweet potato on hand, or the time to bake some off. That\u2019s where my trusty ol\u2019 box grater saves the day. <br> I like to grate the raw sweet potato on the small holes of a box greater. This produces soft, fluffy strands of sweet potato that cook up quickly. I use the other side of the box grater \u2014 the side with the large holes \u2013 to grate the onion, so it breaks down into nice, small pieces. The sweet potato and onion get mixed with some smashed garbanzo beans and seasonings before being formed into patties and pan-fried. The key here is making sure all the garbanzos are smashed \u2014 they\u2019ll hold together better in the patty and won\u2019t go rolling around in the frying pan. <br> I like these patties served with an easy Sriracha and yogurt sauce since it adds a spicy tang and creaminess. These patties are perfect with a peppery arugula salad if you want a light but satisfying dinner. ",

        "How To Make a Cheese Ball",
        "<br> When cream cheese and the happy hostess met, a magical cocktail party food was born. I\u2019m talking about the cheese ball. Creamy, dreamy, and cheesy, this centerpiece of a cheese tray or standalone snack with crackers was the elegant update on dips. The combination of the mildness of cream cheese and the sharpness of the grated cheddar, all amped up with a dash of Dijon and a splash of Worcestershire, made it oh so inviting. <br> Now it\u2019s your turn. The cheese ball may be retro, but there\u2019s a reason that cheese balls have a hallowed place in the hors d\u2019oeuvre hall of fame. Here\u2019s how to master the art of the cheese ball and make it your very own. <br> From the 1950s through the 1970s, cheese balls sat next to every martini and Manhattan at every soir\u00e9e and fancy-pants affair. Sure, to be a \u201ccheese ball\u201d eventually meant that you were corny and sort of hokey, but this food that rocked America remains quick and easy to make. <br> Since it has to be made ahead, it takes any last-minute to-dos off the list. It\u2019s so handy, so versatile, and so good at being a \u201cmake it work, designers\u201d dish that you can probably make two or three fantastically flavorful and creative versions from what you have on hand this very minute. (Tim Gunn would be proud.) So take the cheese ball out of the dustbin of once-trendy foods and you will discover why one of the great American recipes is still rockin\u2019 and ready for your next gathering. <br> Traditional cheese balls are a mixture of cream cheese, grated semi-soft or semi-firm cheese whipped smooth with a few added flavorings, which are then shaped into a ball of about four inches in diameter and rolled in nuts. With crackers, carrot sticks, and celery, they serve the same function as the crudit\u00e9 platters of cut veggies with dip that have commanded parties since the early \u201980s. <br> In many ways, a cheese ball isn\u2019t even a recipe; it\u2019s a concept with four directions. What makes a cheese ball so versatile is that you can quite literally change almost every element and still be good to go. <br> When it comes to the creamy component, cream cheese is the classic foundation, and it works incredibly well. As in any dish with a few ingredients, the quality of what you use becomes vital, so pick the best cheese you can afford. You\u2019ll be stretching any pricey cheese or flavorings with inexpensive cream cheese, which helps keeps this dish both special and doable on most budgets. <br> The single trick to getting a cheese ball to work well is that every ingredient must be at room temperature. Yes, must. Soft, warm cheeses become integrated into a single flavor, with a new texture and aroma that simply cannot occur if you start with cold ingredients. Set the cream cheese and cheeses out on the counter for about an hour before you start and you will be problem-free. <br> <br>For the base cheese:<br> Cream cheese is our first choice for its firm texture and mild creaminess. It creates a base so handy that it is easy to make the mixture into whatever you want. With the addition of one or two ingredients, the base is made firmer and shaped into a sculpture (think football or snowman, not three-foot swan) or softer (think dip). It\u2019s easy to make, easy to modify, and easy to fix. <br> If you feel adventuresome, try mascarpone, quark, neufchatel, creamy feta, soft goat cheese, or fromage blanc as an alternative base to the cream cheese. <br> <br>The second cheese:<br> Once you have the base set, you can get crazy with the second cheese. As long as it\u2019s not a grating cheese or crumbly, like Parmesan or cotija, it\u2019ll work. <br> Don\u2019t leave cream cheese out more than about two hours unrefrigerated, please, but the second cheese can sit out for about four hours; just keep them all covered and away from a hot stove or running dishwasher. <br> A good cheese ball is a study in texture. You want to create contrast between the smooth, creamy interior and the chewy add-ins. Things like crunchy bacon, crackers, and roasted nuts are all ideal toppings. Mince your toppings \u2014 they should be pretty small so they are easily incorporated into the cheese as it spreads. <br> Cheese balls keep extraordinarily well as long as you do not roll them in the outer topping until just before serving. Wrapped in plastic and then foil, a cheese ball will keep for up to a week, making it a great nibble to have on hand during party season or any random get-together. <br> Having some trouble with your cheese ball? No worries. The texture of a cheeseball is super easy to fix, so if you add a few too many optional ingredients, or if the cheese you used ends up runnier than you expected, fear not. ",

        "<br> Once a year, our family escapes to Hawaii \u2014 our home away from home. I love everything about the islands: the friendly people, the unhurried pace, the balmy climate, the sweeping beaches, the glorious sunsets, and the comforting local food. <br> Foremost among the Hawaiian dishes I crave? Kalua pig. <br> Often the headlining dish at a lu\u2019au, kalua pig is the epitome of slow-roasted porky goodness. A few years back, when I found myself back on the mainland and yearning for a messy pile of kalua pig, I came up with a less labor-intensive recipe for this traditional dish. All you need is a big pork shoulder roast, bacon, Hawaiian sea salt, and a pressure cooker. (If you have a little more patience, you can also make <br>Slow-Cooker Kalua Pig<br>!) <br> To replicate the smokiness from cooking the pork for hours in an <br>imu<br> \u2014 a big underground pit oven \u2014 I line the bottom of the pressure cooker with a few slices of bacon. And by the way, if you don\u2019t have any Alaea red sea salt on hand, any coarse salt will work. For kicks and variety, I often use a smoked sea salt in place of the red stuff. <br> I was amazed that this recipe was so easy to make, yet still came out so tasty! The smoky bacon really permeated the pork and reminded me of eating in Hawaii. Letting the cabbage cook in the pork juices at the end meant that none of the deeply flavored cooking liquid was wasted. <br> The leftovers also freeze beautifully and can be used to bulk up stir-fries or other dishes that can use a hit of savory, meaty flavor. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, May 2015<br> ",

        "Recipe: Italian Wedding Soup",
        "<br> When it comes to soups, I can easily say I have a hands-down favorite: Italian wedding soup. My experience of it is neither particularly Italian, nor is it matrimonial, rather it was one of the first real meals my mother fed me when I was a baby. The legend is that I\u2019d slurp it loudly, humming, and the broth would dribble down my neck, soaking the neck of my shirt. <br> The recipe was handed down to my mother, and adapted at each stop, from a man named Fran, whose daughter was my first babyhood friend. I don\u2019t really remember Fran \u2014 he passed away when we were still tiny \u2014 but he lives within me every time I make this soup. Now I see fit to serve it to anyone I love \u2014 from my own little person (who also slurps, dribbles, and hums) to a cozy winter dinner party, where guests often let go of their manners too. <br> We always called it Italian escarole soup because Fran used escarole \u2014 a broad-leafed, less bitter form of endive \u2014 as the green element, although you can use kale, spinach, chard, collards, even broccoli greens. It\u2019s also known as <br>zuppa di scarola <br>or <br>minestra marinata<br> (Italian wedding soup) because of the way the ingredients combine, like a happy love. It is simple to prepare, but has enough flourishes \u2014 herby meatballs and a last-minute addition of cheesy egg ribbons \u2014 to make it special enough for guests. <br> Italian wedding soup has long been one of my favorite soups, but it\u2019s one I\u2019ve never made myself, as I always assumed it was a chore to make all those meatballs before making the soup itself. This recipe proved I\u2019ve been wrong for years. The soup actually comes together quite easily \u2014 I made it on a weeknight for a casual dinner party without fuss. <br> Stirring in the egg mixture in one direction helps to prevent any serious curdling, which was a concern of previous commenters. Also, while the original recipe doesn\u2019t call for adding any pasta to the pot, I\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s not Italian wedding soup without it. Whichever route you choose, though, you won\u2019t be disappointed. <br> \u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, January 2018<br> ",

        "<br> Baking sheets (aka sheet pans) are now touted as the miracle cookware that can <br>cook your whole dinner<br>, but what about breakfast? When an idea for making a sheet-pan breakfast came up, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Here we present to you the hands-down easiest way to make a traditional English breakfast! <br> I remember traveling to Europe after college and staying at cheap little bed and breakfasts and hostels. Being a poor traveler, any included breakfast was a lifesaver, but the ones in Italy and France usually only had bread and yogurt. England and Ireland, however, rolled out the red carpet with full English (or Irish) breakfasts. Those heavy meals fueled long days of walking and made me (and my wallet) incredibly happy. <br> Full English breakfasts have way too much going on in them to make most mornings, but what if you could just cook it all up on one baking sheet and leave some of the other elements, like beans and rashers, out for a faster approach? What if you decided to be a little cheeky and call it a Half English instead? <br> To make this dish, I start by roasting tomatoes on the baking sheet, then add mushrooms and breakfast sausage halfway through. Finally, eggs get cracked right on the baking sheet, baked for a few minutes, and everything\u2019s ready at the same time. <br> I know this isn\u2019t a standard full English breakfast \u2014 there\u2019s no blood sausage or beans (just heat those up on the stove if you wish) \u2014 but you could add rashers (bacon) to the baking sheet if you like, and I would applaud you!

        "<br> Queso dip, for the uninitiated (welcome to the fold!), is an unapologetically cheesy sauce designed for chip-dipping and ladling over fries. And, most importantly for us, it\u2019s the scene-stealer at any party. We\u2019re making this creamy dip in the slow cooker and utilizing a few choice ingredients to ensure it tastes just like the neon nacho cheese sauce you love to break out for parties. <br> So if you\u2019re looking to infuse your game-day menu with a dose of nostalgia, be sure to invite this slow cooker queso dip to the party. <br> The use of Velveeta cheese in this recipe is going to raise some eyebrows, but here\u2019s the thing: Because Velveeta is a shelf-stable cheese product, it can sit in the slow cooker for several hours without getting grainy or gloopy, or separating. It is also so creamy on its own that it only needs a little milk and the heat of the slow cooker to transform it into dip. <br> You won\u2019t find Velveeta in the cheese cooler at the supermarket \u2014 look for it near the canned Parmesan in the pasta aisle. <br> This queso recipe only requires three ingredients. Up the nacho ante by picking out three to four extra toppings for guests to dress up their chips and cheese dip with. While the dip can be thrown together the day of the party, fix up your toppings the day before and stash them, covered, in a serving dish in the fridge. ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Bolognese Sauce",
        "<br> Making a good bolognese sauce is a real labor of love. Sure, you could just add some ground beef to a tomato sauce and call it good (and heck, we often do!), but there\u2019s a certain irresistible silkiness and a deep, meaty flavor that can really only come from all-day cooking. This is a dish that takes a humble package of ground beef and turns it into something worthy of the finest dinner party. Bolognese is that good. <br> The key to a good bolognese is simmering it <br>very<br> slowly over low heat for several hours. This long simmering makes the beef incredibly tender and turns the sauce into something that will make your eyes roll up in your head. I\u2019ve found it tricky to maintain this kind of gentle simmer on the stovetop, where even the lowest burner can be a bit too high, so a few years ago I started using my slow cooker. Its ability to maintain a low, steady heat for hours is perfect for a dish like this. <br> <br>If you don\u2019t have a slow cooker<br>, you can duplicate this recipe in a covered Dutch oven in a 300\u00b0F oven. Check it every hour for doneness and add more of the reserved tomato juices as needed if the bottom of the pot becomes dry. <br> I\u2019ll tell you upfront \u2014 this isn\u2019t one of those slow cooker recipes where you can dump everything together and walk away. But the extra work of browning the beef and saut\u00e9ing the vegetables at the beginning is very much worth it! These steps translate directly into the deep flavor that makes this sauce so irresistible. You can also prepare the beef mixture the night before and finish cooking it with the tomatoes in the slow cooker the next day. Leftovers also freeze well, so go ahead and make a double batch! <br> Serve this bolognese sauce over spaghetti, layer it into a lasagna (as is traditional), or serve it with any other kind of pasta. I particularly like serving it with rotini or campanelle because the little folds are great for catching bits of sauce. <br>For a gluten-free dish<br>, bolognese is also fantastic scooped on top of polenta. <br> This bolognese is a keeper. I\u2019ve made it many, <br>many<br> times since first sharing it on Kitchn in 2008, with very few changes. I love how silky and beefy the sauce becomes over the course of cooking \u2014 we so often think of ground beef as an ingredient meant only for burgers, weeknight tacos, and other quick-fix meals, so it\u2019s always fun to see it get its moment of glory in this sauce. <br> To my original recipe, I\u2019ve added a bit of tomato paste and a pinch of spices. These changes don\u2019t distract from the beefiness or make the dish overly complicated \u2014 they just give the dish a bit of spirit. <br> Thanks so much to everyone who has made this dish over the years and given me feedback! I hope you all continue to enjoy this recipe as much as I do. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Emma<br>, February 2014<br> ",

            "Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, celery, and carrot, and cook until the onion is translucent and all the vegetables have softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. (If your skillet isn't big enough to also accommodate the beef at this point, transfer the vegetables to a 6-quart or larger slow cooker and continue cooking the beef by itself.)",
            "Add the beef, breaking it apart with your spoon and cooking until it is just browned. Stir in 1 teaspoon of the salt along with the thyme, oregano, pepper, and nutmeg.",
            "Stir in the milk and bring it to a rapid simmer. Continue simmering until the milk has reduced completely and very little liquid remains, about 10 minutes. Stir in the wine and simmer again until reduced completely, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef mixture to the bowl of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker.",
            "Open the cans of tomatoes and strain through a strainer, reserving the juices. Transfer the tomatoes to the slow cooker, squishing them in your fist or mashing them against the side of the slow cooker to break them down into small pieces.",
            "Add the bay leaf to the slow cooker and stir everything together. The mixture should have a thick, saucy consistency, neither overly soupy or too dry. If it looks dry, mix in a little of the reserved tomato juices until it looks sauce-like. If it looks too soupy, don't worry about it right now \u2014 you can let excess liquid evaporate at the end of cooking.",
            "Cover the slow cooker and cook on the LOW setting for 6 to 8 hours. (See below for oven-cooking instructions.) In the last 30 minutes of cooking, check the sauce. If it looks soupy, remove the lid to allow any excess liquid to evaporate and reduce the sauce. If it looks a little dry, stir in some of the reserved tomato juices. The finished sauce should be thick and creamy. Serve over cooked pasta or polenta with Parmesan sprinkled on top, or layer it into a lasagna. "

        "<br> Your eyes do not deceive you. This is breakfast that you can eat one-handed while walking to the bus stop, and it\u2019s got just as much going for it a bowl of yogurt with granola and fruit. In fact, it <br>is<br> a bowl of yogurt \u2014 just in frozen, easily-grabbable Popsicle form. Time to dig out those Popsicle molds! <br> I use Greek yogurt for the base of these breakfast pops because I love its tangy flavor and it\u2019s what I usually have in the fridge. Since Greek yogurt is so thick, you need to thin it out with a bit of milk to make it easy to layer into the molds. While you\u2019re at it, whisk in a little honey to keep things sweet. If you\u2019re not into Greek yogurt, you could definitely use regular non-Greek yogurt here instead \u2014 no need to thin it out, though. <br> Now, let\u2019s talk about the jammy berry layer. Fresh berries are so amazing when they\u2019re in season, but even the freshest, ripest berries tend to freeze into tasteless rocks if left to their own devices. This is why I take things one extra step with these pop and make a quick jam with the fresh fruit. Cooking them and adding a bit of sugar gives the berries a deeper flavor that carries over into frozen form, plus the sugar keeps the fruit a soft enough to nibble even when frozen. <br> If you\u2019re short on time or short on berries, you can also substitute a fruit jam or preserves. You\u2019ll need about a cup of preserves for these pops. <br> Use any granola you like here. These pops are especially handy for using up a handful of leftover granola that\u2019s gone a bit stale. Once layered into the molds and frozen, the granola softens to the consistency of soft oatmeal cookies \u2014and yes, that\u2019s just as delicious as you\u2019re hoping it will be. <br> My molds (<br>these<br> from Tovolo) each hold about 1/2 cup of yogurt parfait goodness. For me, this is the perfect amount to start my day or \u2014 let\u2019s be honest here \u2014 finish it. Either way, my freezer is going to be stocked with a steady supply of these yogurt popsicles from now until the end of summer. ",

        "How To Cook Salmon in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> I thought my mother had taught me all of her best tricks in the kitchen, but no \u2014 she had one more for me, which she casually let drop while in the middle of our <br>Costco shopping expedition<br>. It\u2019s this: She buys bulk salmon from Costco and cooks it all at once in the slow cooker. And it\u2019s darn good. <br> Not only is the slow cooker fantastic for this kind of batch cooking, but it\u2019s also an extremely good way to ensure tender, succulent salmon every time, no matter how many fillets you\u2019re cooking. Here\u2019s what to do. <br> Using this method, you can cook a few individual fillets in a small slow cooker, or you can cook a few pounds in a large slow cooker. Place up to two layers of salmon in the slow cooker, stacked with parchment in between. If cooking one layer, add enough liquid to come partway up the side of the salmon. If cooking two layers, add enough liquid to come part way up the side of the top-most layer, submerging the layer beneath. (By the way, I don\u2019t recommend cooking more than two layers because it throws the cooking time off too much and the bottom layer becomes far too overcooked.) <br> Cooking time will vary slightly based not only on the number or size of the fillets you\u2019re cooking, but also your individual slow cooker. Start checking the salmon after about an hour, and then continue cooking until the top-most layer flakes apart easily with a fork and looks cooked to your liking. If you want to double-check the temperature, the salmon is fully cooked when it registers 145\u00b0F in the thickest part. <br> If you\u2019re cooking two layers, the bottom layer will cook slightly faster than the top layer, which means that it will likely be slightly overcooked once the top layer is done. I usually serve the top layer on its own for dinner and save the bottom layer for adding to things like soups and risottos, or for making into fish cakes and burgers \u2014 when the salmon gets used in other recipes like this, it\u2019s usually OK if it was a bit overcooked! <br> Salmon cooked this way makes a mighty-fine dinner all on its own. The flavor will be delicate, so top it with fresh herbs, pesto, or another sauce and serve it with salad or some cooked grains on the side. <br> If you have leftovers \u2014 as you surely will if you\u2019ve bought your salmon in bulk like my mother \u2014 they are great in all sorts of ways. Flake the fillets apart with a fork and add them to chowders and salads, or bake them into casseroles and frittatas. You can also swap salmon for tunafish in a tunafish salad or make fish cakes! If you get tired of salmon for all your meals, you can freeze the leftovers for up to three months. ",

        "<br> I first started making this dish for my parents and siblings when I was in high school. As the eldest girl, I claimed free reign over the kitchen. Over the years I transitioned the recipe from using Cornish hens and boxed rice mix to easier-to-wield chicken pieces and a homemade blend of rice and seasonings. <br> I\u2019ve only used long-grain rice in this dish, but my new Costco find of short-grain brown rice has me eager to make this again soon. <br> Don\u2019t be intimidated by the long cooking time; this is to accommodate the hands-off aspect of cooking the brown rice and the chicken together. Drippings from the chicken blend with the rice and seasonings to make a delicious sauce. <br> Be patient and curl up with a good book while you wait. You really do get to put your feet up with this meal, and the results will have your diners licking their plates. <br> I confess the simplicity of this recipe made me a bit nervous. Could I really throw brown rice and chicken in the oven together? Would they be ready at the same time? The answer is a resounding <br>yes<br>. <br> As Jessica mentions, this does bake for nearly two hours, and into the second hour I was still nervous, as the rice didn\u2019t appear to be soaking up the liquid. But then, around 1 hour 50 minutes, boom \u2014 the rice was moist, fluffy, and ready, seemingly all at once. <br> The long baking time does lead us to recommend bone-in chicken thighs instead of breasts, however. I also added a small amount of smoked paprika for flavor and color. <br> All in all, this is an incredibly easy and quick freezer meal to assemble \u2014 just a bit of chopping and mixing and it\u2019s ready to freeze. On the other end, it bakes up delicious, savory, and comforting. A great family meal. <br> <br>\u2014 <br>Faith<br>, February 2015<br> ",

        "Recipe: Creamy Vegan Queso Dip",
        "<br> Let\u2019s be honest \u2014 thinking of vegan cheese substitutes leaves something to be desired. Maybe you\u2019ve taken a peek at the vegan cheese options in the grocery stores or even dabbled in coaxing a couple hunks of almond cheese to melt atop slices of bread under the broiler. In my experience, that stuff does not melt and will leave your cheese dreams hopelessly shattered. <br> So when coming up with a creamy vegan queso recipe, I wanted to make sure it was as good as the real thing! No shattered dreams here. We\u2019re dreaming big with veggies, cashews, and a ton of spices \u2014 and it\u2019s paying off by the chip-ful. <br> My husband came into the kitchen while I was prepping the veggies for the queso dip. He asked me what I was making, and when I said, \u201cUm, I\u2019m making queso,\u201d he gave me a quizzical glance and looked very skeptically at the piles of carrots and butternut squash I was chopping. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cheese?\u201d he asked. I broke the news that there would be no cheese in this queso. Eventually he gave up on trying to understand my cheese-less antics, and left the kitchen. <br> As I cooked the veggies with plenty of spices, I heard his voice yelling from the living room, \u201cOh, gosh. That smells really good!\u201d So I knew I was on the right track. The softened vegetables went into my Vitamix with green chiles, salsa, cashews, almond milk, and a bunch of nutritional yeast to give it that cheesy flavor. The results were mind-blowing. I dipped a spoon in the finished product, tasted it, and smirked a little bit, knowing that this dip could fool any cheese-lover. <br> I made up a party platter of vegan queso and chips, and called my husband in to the living room to help me \u201ctaste test.\u201d After the first bite, we both descended on the dip like a couple of famished hyenas \u2014 occasionally stopping to tell each other, with full mouths, how much this dip tasted like the real thing.

        "How To Make Soup from Almost Any Vegetable",
        "<br> Soup: It\u2019s the easiest way to warm up your kitchen on a cold day and feed yourself and your family in one delicious and healthy bowl. But you don\u2019t need a recipe to make soup \u2014 especially if you have a clutch of miscellaneous vegetables hanging out in your crisper. Nearly any vegetable can be turned into soup with a little time and effort. <br> If you are craving soup and you have vegetables and broth in your cupboard, you\u2019re all set. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to transforming nearly any kind of vegetable into delicious, nourishing soup. <br> Nearly any vegetable will make tasty soup, Sweet potato, zucchini, squash, turnip, tomato, celery, mushrooms, onions, leeks, cabbage, kale, chard, potatoes, rutabaga, celeriac, cauliflower, broccoli \u2014 the list goes on. <br> The only caveat is that you need to like the flavor of the vegetable. You can tone down turnips\u2019 bitterness with cream or yogurt, and you can offset cabbage\u2019s aroma with creamy white beans or tart lemon, but you can\u2019t entirely erase the taste of a vegetable in soup, so don\u2019t put something in that you <br>really <br>don\u2019t like. <br> Also, nearly any texture of vegetable will work, from tender greens to hard squash, but the cooking time will change. A big pot of chard will cook down quickly, while butternut squash will need more time. <br> When you cook vegetables in stock like this, you have a choice. You can stop cooking when the vegetables are al dente and tender, and slurp up your soup as it is \u2014 chunks and all, an improvised vegetable stew. <br> Or you can pur\u00e9e the soup until creamy. This works with any kind of soup, and you\u2019ll be surprised at how creamy a soup can be with no dairy at all. But I tend to like this best with sweet, dense vegetables like squash and sweet potato. <br> It\u2019s up to you \u2014 to pur\u00e9e or not to pur\u00e9e! ",

        "<br> Sometimes cucumbers bore me to tears. No offense, cucumber, but your chill flavor can be a little underwhelming at times! It wasn\u2019t until I began spiralizing cucumber into long, elegant strands that my affection for this vegetable really began to change. <br> The real key to this recipe isn\u2019t the fact that cucumbers have been made into noodles, but that the noodle are very thin. This alone has made cucumber even more enticing for me. While the size of the noodle is 100 percent a personal preference (after all, this salad can be made with ribbon-cut cucumbers as well), the smaller size twirls around the fork in such a satisfying manner that it\u2019s hard to not to smile when you tuck into a bowl. <br> This chilled salad is tart and refreshing and gets just a hint of savory, toasty flavor from the tablespoon of toasted sesame oil. It stores surprisingly well in the fridge and is just as delicious on day one as it is on day three or four. ",

        "How To Make Perfect Bacon in the Oven",
        "<br>I think we can agree that crispy, smoky bacon is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures. However, standing over a hot stove dodging sputtering bacon grease is not. Here is how we can have the best of both worlds: a hands-free, hassle-free method for cooking perfect bacon, all in the oven.<br> I was a skeptic of oven-baked bacon at first. Give up cooking the long strips in my beloved cast iron skillet? Really? There\u2019s just something that feels so nostalgic and <br>right<br> about cooking bacon that way \u2014 tenderly flipping and monitoring the progress of every slice, although yes, while nursing the occasional oil-spatter burn. For a few quick slices, I still think a skillet is the way to go; but when cooking a pound or more of bacon for a big Saturday brunch or for a week of easy meal add-ins, I am a total oven-baked-bacon convert. <br> I find that a pound of medium-thick bacon fits on a single baking sheet. To cook even more (or if your bacon doesn\u2019t all fit on one sheet), you can cook two baking sheets at once. <br> It\u2019s just so easy \u2014 there\u2019s no flipping or monitoring involved. You just lay the bacon on a baking sheet, stick it in the oven, and set a timer. The strips of bacon bubble away in the oven (no splattering!) and gradually become the crispy, golden-hued, irresistible bacon we know and love. <br> Bacon cooked in the oven definitely gets crispy, but I also find that it retains a bit of chewiness near the middle, especially when cooking thick-cut bacon. I love this, but if you love your bacon crispy through and through, then you might try baking it on top of a metal cooling rack set over the baking sheet. Lifting the bacon up lets it cook from all sides and get even crispier. <br> Do you cook your bacon this way? Have any other tips to add? ",

        "How To Make Really Good Restaurant-Style Ramen at Home",
        "<br> Ramen is a Japanese soup, by way of Chinese noodles, that has become an American obsession. Not only have ramen noodles become part of our cultural lexicon in their ubiquitous dried mass-produced packets that sustained a generation of latch-key kids and college students, but they also grew to a burgeoning restaurant sub-culture of scavenger-hunt ramen shop tours and enthusiastic slurping. <br> With this recipe, we\u2019re exploring how to do that enthusiastic slurping at home. We\u2019ll tackle the important components of ramen \u2014 broth, seasoning, noodles, and toppings \u2014 with respect to our obsession but with a bit of grace and ease. <br> At its most basic, ramen is a soup of well-seasoned broth and noodles. Toppings like meat and eggs help make the bowl a meal, but they\u2019re not where we\u2019ll put our efforts in this recipe. Here, we\u2019re concentrating on a richly flavored chicken broth and selecting the best noodles. <br> Ramen noodles are actually a Chinese invention that grew roots in Japan. The bouncy ramen noodles gained popularity in the 1930s as Chinese immigrants began cooking in soba shops. The blending of Chinese noodles with Japanese broth making and eating rituals gave birth to many modern styles, with ramen shops and noodle carts becoming fixtures of Japanese dining. During World War II, push carts and street vendors were made illegal as many ingredients were rationed, and ramen nearly went extinct. <br> American ramen shops were likely born around this time as well, as many Japanese noodle makers left the country during the post-war economic downturn. While these 1960s-born ramen shops might not have seen the popularity that more modern ramen shops have today, it\u2019s worth noting that most of these shops outlasted the diner fare also popular during this era. <br> At the same time, instant ramen was also introduced to America, marketed as healthy food to busy families. Oodles of Noodles, Cup of Ramen, and products of their ilk didn\u2019t see fame until the 1980s. The \u201980s also saw the advent of Japanese \u201cramen tours\u201d that became, and remain, a popular sightseeing expedition for hungry American travelers. <br> Culturally speaking, ramen shops are one of the few fast food icons to avoid franchise conglomeration with a simple system of <br>noren ramen<br>. Loosely translated to mean branch shops, ramen shop keepers are reputed to teach employees their ramen recipes, then send these employees off to open their own shops after just a few years of service. This is good for ramen-lovers, but also means that ramen recipes, methods, and traditions have morphed slightly, like a long game of telephone over the last two decades in America. <br> Making the best ramen at home begins with your shopping cart. If you keep the staples for <br>making dashi<br> on hand (kombu and dried mushrooms), plus a good soy sauce and mirin, you\u2019re on your way to a near-complete ramen-at-home kit. Ramen noodles will round out the kit. <br> Ramen broth is much like any rich soup broth, in that it uses bones and aromatics to make a base for noodles and toppings. The most significant difference between ramen broth and plain stock is the two-part flavoring system. Kombu and dried shiitake mushrooms enhance the broth while it cooks, giving the broth an earthy taste unlike other broths. <br> The second addition to ramen broth is a system of flavoring known as <br>tare. <br>Tare is a mixture of intensely flavorful liquids or pastes that are added to the ramen broth just before serving. The most basic is a 50/50 mixture of soy sauce and mirin. Some are made with miso or include chili pastes. <br> For a restaurant-quality bowl of ramen anytime, keep kombu and dried shiitakes on hand for enhancing even homemade broth. Ditto for soy sauce and mirin. You may also want to keep pickled bamboo shoots and nori on hand for ramen enhancements. <br> Fresh ramen noodles are nothing more than wheat noodles, made from flour, salt, and water, but treated with an alkaline agent that gives the noodles their yellow hue and springy, chewy texture. Fresh noodles are more common in major cities like New York where ramen noodle producers are within close proximity. If you see them in the refrigerator section, snatch them up and enjoy them in ramen within a few days. <br> Dried or instant ramen noodles are also made from wheat flour, but fried then dried before packaging. At most Asian markets, you can find packets of these dried noodles without the tiny soup flavoring packets, so grab these and keep multiples on hand for making ramen anytime. <br> Our ramen broth is a combination of a rich chicken stock and a flavorful dashi broth. By using inexpensive chicken wings, roasting them before turning them into stock, and adding dashi essentials to the broth, we create a layered, flavorful broth ideal for ramen at home. <br> Body, or thickness, is the difference between restaurant-quality ramen at home and the ramen we enjoy from cups or packets. Chicken wings deliver this body in spades. Their joints, skin, and tender bones break down during a long simmer, producing a gelatin-rich broth hearty enough to stand up against springy ramen noodles. This ramen broth is also flavored with ginger, kombu, dried shiitake mushrooms, and soy sauce. <br> <br>Read more: <br>5 Expert Tips for Making the Perfect Bowl of Ramen<br> <br> There is truly no wrong way to eat ramen. Tradition dictates that the noodles should be devoured while the broth is still hot, which means bringing your mouth closer to the bowl and using chopsticks to guide the noodles to your mouth. This maneuver is likely the mother of the ramen slurp. Sucking the noodle into your mouth also cools the noodles on their way in. A soup spoon can and should be used in conjunction with chopsticks for sipping the broth and enjoying the ramen\u2019s egg topping. <br> <br>Read more<br>: <br>Slurping Ramen: Unexpected Table Manners Around the World<br> ",

The cardamom, of course, is pure bliss. I was unnecessarily skeptical about the lime \u2014 it\u2019s not a distinct flavor, but rather adds a light touch and keeps the smoothie from being too heavy. The last dash of cinnamon and sea salt? That\u2019s what takes this smoothie right over the top. ",

        "How To Cook Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs in the Oven",
        "<br> I am a huge, huge fan of boneless, skinless chicken thighs. They are inexpensive, tasty, and easy to cook. In fact, I find it difficult to mess up chicken thighs. They are just dark enough to stay tender, but not so dark as to put off people who prefer white meat. Everyone who eats regularly at my house has eaten chicken thighs! <br> In the summer I grill these babies every week, especially when I have a big table of people to feed. But in the winter, when I don\u2019t feel like stepping outside to the grill but <br>do<br> feel like turning on the oven, I bake the chicken in the oven. It\u2019s easy as 1-2-3. Here\u2019s what I do. <br> I just love how quick these are. They are truly a weeknight meal. You can come in the door with a package of meat, throw off your coat, and pop these right in the oven. You\u2019ll have just enough time to open a bottle of wine and toss together a salad before they\u2019re done. <br> I want to bring this up before we get to the recipe because I think it\u2019s always worth talking about where you get your meat. And I certainly don\u2019t mean to be didactic \u2014 I think meat is something most of us are conscious of, and we all try to get the best stuff we can. My point is really to say that chicken thighs are one of the cheapest, easiest things to buy organic or pasture-raised. Even at a high-end butcher counter, these only cost me $4/pound, for instance. <br> If you want to add a little more punch to the chicken, you can make a quick sauce of nearly any oil, acid, and spices. Here, for instance, I combined a couple tablespoons olive oil, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, garlic cloves, and a dash of red pepper flakes. I often make Asian-inspired sauces with sesame oil, rice vinegar, and lots of chili-garlic sauce. You can also pour pre-made salad dressing over the chicken. ",

        "<br> If summer is a season full of discovery, color, and unexpected flavors, winter can feel like a parade of nearly identical gnarled roots and fibrous greens. To combat culinary monotony, I rely on two strategies: Buy all the citrus, and splurge on fresh herbs. <br> From grapefruit to mandarins, a vivid tropical fruit is soul-soothing. As for the herbs, I find they\u2019re a nice way to play up otherwise repetitive flavors and make cold weather recipes sing. <br> <br>Read more: <br>5 Citrus Fruits to Try This Winter<br> <br> This salad is deceptively simple. A mix of ruby red grapefruit and Cara Cara and mandarin oranges is the centerpiece, but the complex flavors come from tossing the fruit with fresh tarragon, parsley, and spring mix dressed in an irresistibly smoky tahini dressing. Citrus and herbs: the remedy for winter boredom. ",

        "<br> I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re about to make your neighbors very jealous. They will smell this cooking as they walk up to, and then pass by, your door \u2014 forced to smell those aromas of garlic, chicken, and cumin, all without getting a single bite. <br> You, and only you, will get to come home from work, take a bowl from the cupboard, and proceed immediately to the table without even needing to turn on the stove. It\u2019s white chicken chili for dinner tonight, my friends! Inviting the neighbors is up to you. <br> What defines a \u201cwhite chicken chili\u201d is a rabbit hole that I\u2019m not sure we want to go down when dinner is waiting. Personally, my aim is a hearty chicken stew with big white beans, Southwest spices like cumin and coriander, and a few cans of fire-roasted green chilis. It\u2019s a nice balance of creaminess from the beans, warmth from the spices, and tangy brightness from the green peppers. <br> This particular recipe makes a very mild chili. If you\u2019d like a bit more heat, roast a few poblanos or jalape\u00f1os, chop them up, and add them along with the other peppers at the beginning of cooking. You can also add a pinch of cayenne or red pepper flakes, or do as I do and bring out the hot sauce collection when dinner time rolls around. <br> As long as we\u2019re adapting this recipe to our own personal taste, perhaps you\u2019re looking for an extra dose of creaminess here? If that\u2019s what you\u2019re craving, make a quick white sauce thickened with flour and whisk that into the chili toward the end of cooking. Instructions for this are in the Recipe Notes at the end of the recipe. <br> Do you have a favorite riff on white chicken chili? I\u2019d love to hear it and try it in my next batch! ",

Well, consider this a snack-sized, two-bite, chocolate-dipped version that lives in your freezer, just waiting for that craving for \u201ca little something sweet\u201d to hit. These frozen bites require no blending or pur\u00e9eing (just chop up a banana, dip, and freeze), and yet they\u2019re as creamy and sweet on the inside a spoonful of ice cream \u2014 only better. <br> I don\u2019t know about you, but dipping anything in chocolate always seems to be an inherently messy affair. But because I also can\u2019t seem to resist the temptation of \u201cchocolate-dipped\u201d anything, I\u2019ve discovered a few secrets. <br> The most fun part of this project, though, is definitely picking the toppings. I\u2019m a big fan of chopped peanuts \u2014 roast them in the oven for a few minutes before chopping to really bring out their flavor and crunchiness, if you have the time. I also really like flaked coconut, and sprinkles are a top choice if you happen to be sharing your snack bounty with any children. Use your imagination here \u2014 almost any favorite ice cream toppings can be used for this snack. <br> One last note before we skip the preamble and dive into making these bites. Under no circumstances should you freeze the bites before dipping or leave them at room temperature after being frozen. I tried this thinking that the chocolate might freeze in a thinner coat in the former situation and make a good snack-on-the-go in the latter. But unfortunately, the banana pieces turn to mush as they thaw, making both situations messy and unappetizing. <br> Have you ever made banana bites like these? I\u2019d love to hear what variations you\u2019ve tried! ",

        "Recipe: Blueberry Pie Overnight Oats",
        "<br> As someone who consumes far too much muesli with yogurt, it\u2019s not surprising that bircher muesli (or \u201covernight oats,\u201d as it has popularly become known) is also a favorite of mine. Overnight oats are incredibly easy to make ahead of time, and they\u2019re perfect for on-the-go breakfasts. <br> This particular recipe is a fun variation on my usual overnight oats. It takes a bit of extra time to make the crumbly streusel topping but it\u2019s definitely worth it. Dessert for breakfast? Oh, yes. <br> You don\u2019t need to cook the oats at all for this recipe. Just layer your dry ingredients in a jar, pour the liquid ingredients over top, shake, and chill. Overnight, the oats absorb the liquid and soften, while the dried fruit becomes plump. I love mixing coconut yogurt into the oats, as it adds flavor and extra creaminess that overnight oats can lack when made with just milk. <br> The exciting part (for me, at least!) comes with the crumbly \u201cpie crust\u201d topping. It\u2019s caramelized and crispy, so it\u2019s a great pairing with the soft oats beneath. I find one spoonful of topping is just about right for me, so this recipe will stretch to last for several servings \u2014 which means at least four easy breakfasts, ready to go. If you feel like the topping is too sweet for breakfast or if you simply don\u2019t want the hassle of making it, feel free to leave it out altogether or just sprinkle your favorite granola over top instead.

        "<br> Do you eat steel-cut oats for breakfast? This time of year I turn to them gladly; there\u2019s nothing like a bowl of hot, tender, pearly oats, all creamy and delicious. Steel-cut oats take a little longer to cook than rolled oats, but that\u2019s not a problem. Set them up the night before and you\u2019ll have hot oatmeal in the morning almost instantly. It takes only two or three minutes to heat them up. Here\u2019s how I prep my oatmeal the night before. <br> I call for one cup of oats here. This will make enough for three to five servings. Remember: When you make steel-cut oats you really should make enough for a whole week, or at least several days. Unlike gluey, sticky rolled-oat oatmeal, steel-cut oatmeal is <br>great<br> when reheated the next day. It just gets creamier \u2014 not ickier. <br> So make a big pot and eat out of it all week. ",

        "<br> My chef sister, Fiona, is my go-to source for hands-on cooking advice and one of my biggest culinary heroes and influences. But even more important? Fiona came up with an umami-packed, Thai-inspired chicken recipe that immediately became a family favorite. <br> Her green marinade is a breeze to throw together: Simply blend together a sweet onion, handfuls of herbs, fish sauce, apple juice, lime zest, and pepper. The marinade pairs well with just about every protein imaginable, and it works great as a sauce for pouring over grilled meats or drizzling in soup. <br> <br>Pro tip!<br> Make a double batch of the recipe and freeze half of the marinated chicken for a future meal. <br> I\u2019ve never marinated chicken in fish sauce before, but the results were fantastic. The chicken didn\u2019t taste fishy, but just had really deep, savory flavors that were balanced out by all the fresh herbs blended into the sauce. <br> I love that this recipe can be cooked on a grill or just baked on a rack in the oven for an easy weeknight meal. <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, May 2015<br> ",

        "Recipe: Cuban Black Bean Soup",
        "<br> When I was a kid, we lived in Miami, and we had a Cuban neighbor whom I now only remember as \u201cMrs. Garcia.\u201d She had arrived in Miami via boat from Cuba, and I don\u2019t know where she is now, but she gave my mother her recipe for black bean soup, which I still use to this day. So wherever you are, Mrs. Garcia, thank you for this recipe. It has ruined me for all other black bean soups \u2014 nothing I\u2019ve had in Cuban restaurants matches up to this. <br> While the ingredient list and hands-on preparation time of this classic soup are both short, the beans have to be soaked overnight and the soup itself takes several hours to cook, so I think this is best made on the weekend when you\u2019ll be home all day to stir and season the soup as it cooks. It fills the house with a wonderful aroma, too, which is a bonus. <br> And last but not least, the vinegar is the secret ingredient; it makes the soup more creamy and gives it a little \u201ctang.\u201d <br> I love black bean soup, so I had been meaning to try this recipe of Kathryn\u2019s for a long time. Black bean soup reminds me of my years living in Florida, where soups like this one were menu staples of many of the restaurants in my neighborhood. <br> This soup does not disappoint. It has the depth of flavor that beans develop as they cook, slowly \u2014 not to mention the richness from a ham hock slowly falling apart in the pot. The soup was extremely easy and quick to prepare \u2014 it took me five minutes to refill the bean pot and add the vegetables. It cooked, long and slow, and covered with a lid so I didn\u2019t even have to worry about the water boiling off. <br> The result was an irresistibly creamy soup \u2014 and a lot of it! This is one to make, eat for a few days, and then freeze as a little care package for your future self. <br> \u2013 <br>Faith<br>, October 2012<br> ",

        "Essential Recipe: Balsamic Vinaigrette",
        "<br> Knowing how to make a basic vinaigrette for salads is one of the best skills a home cook can have. And happily, this is as easy as combining olive oil and vinegar in a jar with some salt and fresh-cracked black pepper, and then giving that jar a shake. You barely even need a recipe. <br> The standard ratio for vinaigrettes is three parts oil to one part vinegar. But it\u2019s a flexible ratio, so use more vinegar if you like a tart dressing or more oil if you like it richer. This is also not something for which you need to take out the measuring cups \u2014 eye-balling the proportions right in the salad bowl or jam jar is perfectly acceptable behavior. <br> Balsamic vinaigrette will take you far in life. This is made just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and the balsamic adds just the right touch of sweetness when tossed with salad greens. If you\u2019re feeling fancy, you can add other ingredients the mix, like a dollop of grainy mustard, some minced shallots, or a tablespoon of fresh chopped herbs. If you\u2019d like a little more sweetness, whisk in some brown sugar or honey. <br> And since we\u2019re talking variations, definitely use this basic recipe as a template for all your vinaigrette desires. Swap out the balsamic for a good red wine vinegar or even freshly squeezed lemon juice. Infuse your olive oil with garlic or other spices for another layer of flavor. The sky is the limit here. <br> I usually make about a cup of dressing at a time and keep it in a jam jar on my counter (no need to refrigerate unless you add fresh ingredients!). This will last me through about a week\u2019s worth of salads. The vinegar and oil will separate after a few minutes, but shaking the jar to re-combine the vinaigrette is just as easy as pulling a store-bought bottle out of the fridge. <br> <br> Do you make your own balsamic vinaigrette? What\u2019s your favorite variation?<br> <br> <br>A version of this post was originally published 2/11/11. The recipe and text have been updated.<br> <br> <br>(Images: <br>Emma Christensen<br>)<br> ",

        "How To Make the Best Chicken Noodle Soup",
        "<br> You\u2019ve got the sniffles. It\u2019s chilly outside. You want nothing more than to wrap yourself in a big ol\u2019 blanket and settle down with a mug of chicken noodle soup. Am I right? Then this is the recipe for you. It\u2019s miles better than anything from a box or a can, but isn\u2019t quite so laborious as starting with a whole chicken and <br>making stock from scratch<br>. It\u2019s the Goldilocks of chicken soups, and it\u2019s just right. <br> This shortcut chicken soup gives you real shreds of meaty chicken, and a broth with delicious extra richness. But it doesn\u2019t take the hours of a full old-fashioned chicken soup, where you use a whole chicken to make stock, then take the chicken apart piece by piece for the soup. It\u2019s a quicker version, yes, but one that stays true in spirit and taste to the most old-fashioned sort of homemade chicken soup. Brothy, golden, nourishing \u2014 this is <br>real<br> chicken soup \u2014 just a little bit faster. <br> I prefer using chicken thighs for this soup. Not only do thighs stay tender and delicious when simmered, but their natural richness makes the soup more substantial. Buy bone-in thighs if you can; the bones make the broth even better. (You can use chicken breasts if you like, though I still suggest using bone-in.) <br> Noodles in chicken noodle soup is a deeply personal matter. Some prefer swirly egg noodles like those pictured. Others insist linguini is the way to go. Still others like to break spaghetti into little matchsticks before cooking them. Use whichever noodle feels most comforting to you. <br> Even if you\u2019re not feeling under the weather, this is a very satisfying soup to make if you just want something cozy. It comes together in under an hour and makes the house smell fantastic. ",

        "How To Make the Best Lentil Dal at Home",
        "<br> \u201cDal\u201d has a double meaning: It is both the word for lentils and beans and the term for a thick pur\u00e9e or soup made from lentils. Lentil dal is essentially just a lentil soup. However, to say dal is simple also cuts its significance of flavor, of history, and importance at the South Asian table. <br> Lentil dal is a layered dish with thousands of variations determined by everything from the availability of certain ingredients to family traditions. But amongst them all, two components are essential to dal: tender lentils and tempered spices. <br> Soft-cooked lentils stewed in an aromatic broth full of onions, garlic, and ginger become the base of most dals. Tomatoes, potatoes, or other vegetables can be added as well, but those elements depend on the cook, the region, and the traditions that influence what goes in the pot. <br> In this recipe, we\u2019re favoring a preparation of dal that starts and finishes with the temperating of aromatics and spices and lentils simmered in a tomato-based broth. This tempering, sometimes called <br>chaunk<br>, <br>tarka<br>, or <br>tadka<br>, is what distinguishes dal from lentil soup. Our efforts are focused on purchasing the right lentils for a quick-cooking base and making a flavorful tadka. <br> Lentils are an ancient food. They\u2019re well-known for their ability to grow in poor soil with little water, complementing grains to provide a complete protein, and nourishing whole civilizations. Early lentil dishes were likely cooked, along with early grains, over open fires to soften them into nutrient-dense porridges. <br> Cultivated throughout the Middle East, food historians believe lentils were introduced to India by Egyptians. India consumes more than half of the world\u2019s lentils today, where they cultivate more than 50 varieties of these pulses. Lentils are a fixture of dining, with some lentil dishes appearing on the table at all meal times. Similarly, you\u2019ll find lentil dishes in the cuisines of many South Asian countries and in the areas where their diaspora has expanded. In Nepal, lentils are apart of dal bhat or lentils and rice, and in the West Indies and Guyana, dal recipes often reflect a hybridization of the landscape and traditional preparations. <br> More than anything, dal is comfort food at its finest. Served over rice or with rotis and chapatis, it is as nourishing as it is soothing. Quick-cooking dal is made from split lentils (in this recipe we went with red) and can be dressed up with the addition of the tempering spices. Once you learn the technique, experiment with a tadka combination of your own to customize this dish. That\u2019s the beauty of dal \u2014 it\u2019s made for personalization. <br> I\u2019m willing to bet that your local grocery store has everything you need to make dal, but a South Asian market will provide more varieties of lentils, ghee, and fresh spices and is worth exploring if you have one locally. <br> <br>Ghee<br>: Ghee is clarified butter made from butter that has been cooked to remove its moisture and milk fat in order to make it suitable for high-heat cooking. You can find ghee in shelf-stable containers at most grocery stores. Or, with some fresh butter and time, you can make your own at home anytime you need it. Although the milk solid are gone, ghee retains a flavor reminiscent of butter. In dal, it imparts an undercurrent of nuttiness and is the fat used for tempering the spice given its smoking point is rather high \u2014 around 400\u00baF. <br> <br>Read more: <br>How to Make Clarified Butter and Ghee<br> <br> <br>Lentils<br>: Lentils or dal are part of the pulse family. Pulses include lentils, split peas, and beans. Pulses are a specific subcategory of the broad legume family, as they are edible, dry beans that are grown specifically for culinary consumption. <br> Yellow, pink, and red lentils are primarily used for dal. Red split lentils are best for quick-cooking dal and are used in this recipe for that reason. Buy these in bulk and store them in the pantry for up to a year. Before using the lentils, rinse them like you would a grain to remove any rocks or off-color lentils. <br> We reached out to Neela Paniz, author of <br>The New Indian Slow Cooker<br> <br>to learn more about the art of tempering. \u201cThe blooming of whole spices enhances the flavor of the dal, giving us the variety that one gets all over the country,\u201d says Neela. \u201cThis process of blooming spices \u2014 be it in ghee or oil \u2014 is called a \u2018tadka\u2019 or \u2018baghar\u2019. Releasing the flavors of the spices and saut\u00e9ing the aromatics lends the specific flavor desired to the recipe. Thus, in my opinion, without a tadka, there is no dal! Just do not burn your spices!\u201d <br> We\u2019re calling for cooking not only whole cumin and black pepper in the tadka, but also garlic. These three should be cooked in ghee, as they need a high heat to temper correctly. You <br>could<br> swap ghee for vegetable oil, but you\u2019ll lose a lot of flavor. Watch the tadka carefully while cooking, as you\u2019ll want to brown but not burn the garlic. Browned garlic might seem odd, but it is essential to tadka and gives this dish its distinct taste. <br> \u201cThe dynamics of an Indian meal is what makes a lentil recipe into a dal. More often than not, dal is eaten either with rice or some kind of flat bread,\u201d says Neela. Dal\u2019s thickness varies depending on the lentils used and may be thick like a curry or thin like a broth. How much water is used in cooking and any mashing or pur\u00e9eing at the end will make the soup thinner or thicker. We worked to strike a middle ground between thick and thin with a recipe that calls for split lentils and by using a potato masher. If you prefer a thicker soup, skip the mashing. For a thinner soup, pur\u00e9e with an immersion blender before adding the tadka. <br> Ramen, pho, and thom kha gai are some of our favorite dishes to eat out, but we tasked ourselves with mastering these soups at home \u2014 with equipment we already have and ingredients that are easily found. By pulling in expert advice, shopping smartly, and putting our broth and stock know-how to work, we\u2019re bringing these soups into our home kitchens. ",

        "<br> You don\u2019t have to be Italian to appreciate the bake-and-serve simplicity of a big plate of stuffed shells. It\u2019s the kind of Sunday supper that transcends tradition to make everyone happy. So when you\u2019ve got a whole mess of people to feed, this is the dish that benefits both host and guests. There\u2019s no unexpected additions of spinach to keep picky eaters away, and no hidden meat, so vegetarians will be happy. (Although that\u2019s not to say you couldn\u2019t sub in some saut\u00e9ed greens or sausage if you wanted!) <br> If you really want to spread the prep out over a few days, the shells can be boiled, and then tossed with a bit of vegetable oil or olive oil before cooling and refrigerating in a covered container. The entire pan can also be frozen for future potlucks \u2014 <br>follow these instructions for freezing enchiladas<br> and line the pan with parchment paper for easy removal. <br> This is a recipe I\u2019ve turned to more than a few times since it was first published. It satisfies all my cravings for Italian-American, red sauce comfort food and it can easily be scaled to feed a crowd. There\u2019s nothing I feel really needs to be changed here, except I\u2019ve scaled up the amount of marinara sauce to ensure the shells are extra saucy. <br> \u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, January 2018<br> ",

        "<br> Have you ever wondered what cinnamon rolls would taste like, sans cinnamon? Why aren\u2019t there more recipes for sticky, gooey, and sweet breakfast rolls without cinnamon or caramel? There are so many other wonderful options! <br> I was craving a buttery, flaky breakfast bun with the sweet, tangy, taste of lemon \u2014 so I made one up. <br> These rolls are amazing, if I do say so myself! The first time I made them they were a smash hit, and they\u2019ve continued to be so every time since. <br> They are modeled after the classic cinnamon roll, and partially inspired by <br>this bread<br>, with a buttery yeast dough flecked with nutmeg and lemon. But inside each roll is a rich filling of sugar and lemon that bakes into gooey, oozy sweet-tart deliciousness. The cream cheese glaze puts it over the top, with more lemon tartness and not too much sweetness. These are my new go-to breakfast rolls. <br> These rolls are not difficult, and like other breakfast roll recipes, they can be made at night and put in the refrigerator overnight for easy and quick baking in the morning. This is so convenient for parties and holiday brunches. <br> The final word on them comes from my mother, who looked at me, wide-eyed, over the brunch table, and said, solemnly, \u201cThis is the best thing I ever put in my mouth.\u201d <br> I\u2019ve made these rolls many times since I first published the recipe in 2010. I\u2019ve struggled with writing the recipe in the most helpful way; organizing the flow around when and how the lemons are zested and juiced felt more complicated than it should be. I\u2019ve rewritten the recipe now with a different flow, one that I think makes more sense. <br> Every time I\u2019ve made this recipe the rolls have been just as transcendent as that first time \u2014 buttery, flaky, sunny with lemon. <br> \u2013 <br>Faith<br>, April 2014<br> ",

        "Recipe: Lemon Potato Chowder",
        "<br> Cold weather conjures memories of my mom\u2019s creamy potato soup, with its tiny pools of melted butter and black pepper flecks on the surface. It was rich and sating, but also simple and balanced. <br> That simplicity and balance was front and center as I invented my own take on my mom\u2019s recipe. A cache of lemons on my countertop presented the chance to push the envelope. I wanted a soup that was creamy, sure, but also tangy and vivid. My potato soup is every bit as comforting as the recipe I remember, but the hint of zest and generous squeeze of lemon enliven the dish, making for a happy, almost playful soup that pops. <br> With such a simple list of ingredients, details matter. You\u2019ll want to cook the onions with care, until they\u2019re supple and almost melt into the butter. Then, give the same care to the celery and carrots. <br> When pur\u00e9eing the soup, I like to leave a bit of texture; you can do this by either pulsing just until soup is mostly smooth or removing the potatoes with a slotted spoon, blending them with a few cups of broth, and then stirring back into the textured broth.

We wrote about <br>red wine hot chocolate<br> a couple months ago, after we saw it popping up on Pinterest, and instantly knew we needed to create a recipe for our readers. Red wine hot chocolate really is as simple and delicious as it sounds; it\u2019s something to enjoy with friends after a wintery meal, or by yourself curled up on the couch on a snowy day. <br> Grab an inexpensive bottle of red at your local wine store tonight and make your boozy chocolate dreams come to life. <br> Spike our <br>go-to recipe for hot chocolate <br>with red wine and it suddenly becomes instantly richer and more luxurious. A fruity red wine like a Merlot or Zinfandel works best here, as it plays in harmony with the delicately bitter dark chocolate and caramel notes in brown sugar. <br> The trick to making this warm drink a real star, though, is giving it an extra kick with cinnamon. Just a touch of the spice boosts the drink\u2019s warming quality, adds intrigue, and rounds everything out. <br> This is the kind of drink that\u2019s meant for quiet nights at home, but it\u2019s also special enough to serve to your friends at the end of a cozy dinner party; it\u2019ll warm up their bones so they can muster the strength to step back out into the cold.

        "How To Make French Meringue",
        "<br> So simple and pure, meringue makes for the lightest, almost cloud-like cookies and pastries. With a crisp outer shell, slightly chewy center, and a subtle sweetness, baked meringue is a melt-in-your-mouth delight. It\u2019s also extremely versatile \u2014 after mastering the basics of how to whip meringue, you\u2019ll be making these underrated cookies for almost any occasion. <br> Sure, meringue might not be as popular as the almighty <br>chocolate chip cookie<br> or as drool-worthy as a <br>chewy chocolate brownie<br>, but I\u2019ll bet you can\u2019t eat just one meringue cookie. <br> Meringue is the heavenly, airy alternative to all those other heavy, sugary, buttery cookies; it\u2019s guaranteed to brighten your day after that first crisp bite. Toss in some ground spices, add a swirl of food coloring, or sprinkle some shaved almonds over top \u2014 you can transform plain meringue into a dainty, whimsical treat that\u2019s a total crowd-pleaser. <br> Made from just sugar and egg whites (and a few other optional ingredients for flavoring), turning meringue into delicate cookies is quite simple. First you whip the egg whites until frothy, then start whipping in the sugar. Keep whipping until the meringue holds tall, sturdy peaks when you lift the whisk out of the bowl. After that, all you have to do is bake the meringue low and slow until totally crisp. <br> Since there are so few ingredients and instructions, it is important to follow everything closely. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some tips and tricks for whipping up a proper meringue, as well as some things to avoid. <br> <br>For maximum volume, it is important to keep your egg whites and all of your equipment as free from fat as possible. This means no grease in your mixing bowl and no drips of egg yolk in the whites. Try using glass, stainless steel, or copper mixing bowls; avoid plastic bowls since they can be porous and hold grease. In addition to being free from grease, make sure the mixing bowl and whisk are both dry. <br> What should you do if a bit of yolk ends up in your whites? Try to fish the yolk out as best as possible. A tiny drip of yolk probably won\u2019t keep your whites from whipping, but it may take longer to do so. Break a whole yolk in your whites? You are probably best off starting over. <br> Room-temperature eggs whip up better than cold ones. After separating the egg whites from the yolks, let them rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes before whipping. <br> To make sure the sugar dissolves completely, add it in very gradually. You will want to avoid dumping in a large amount at one time. In the end, the meringue should be silky and not at all grainy (which would mean you still have undissolved sugar). Rub a little between your fingers \u2014 it should feel totally smooth and creamy. <br> To help stabilize the meringue, mix in a bit of cream of tartar. It might not increase the volume of the meringue, but it will help keep it from breaking down to0 quickly. <br> <br>As mentioned, make sure no fat comes into contact with your egg whites, either in the form of egg yolk or residual grease. Although difficult to do, try not to over-whip the egg whites. Once they reach stiff peaks, stop the mixer; the meringue should be glossy. <br> To avoid cracks and unnecessary browning in your baked meringues, be sure that your oven is fully warmed, but not actually too hot before baking the meringue \u2014 it\u2019s best to use an <br>oven thermometer<br> to check the temperature. <br> If possible, also try to avoid baking meringues on humid or rainy days. If so, you may need to increase the baking time and let them completely dry out before using or storing. <br> <br>Meringue can simply be scooped out onto a baking sheet with a soup spoon or a cookie scoop to make rustic, billowy cookies, or you can pipe it for neater, more uniform cookies. Try using a plain or star tip to pipe out meringue \u201ckisses.\u201d For rosettes, pipe the meringue in a tight coil. <br> This same meringue can also be used to make <br>pavlova<br>. Draw a ring on a piece of parchment paper and use a large spoon to scoop the meringue into a round shape on the baking sheet. Use the back of the spoon to hollow out the center to create a large \u201cbowl\u201d of meringue. To make a finished pavlova, fill the baked meringue bowl with pastry or whipped cream and fresh fruit! To make individual pavlovas, pipe out mini meringue \u201cnests.\u201d <br> <br>An assortment of flavor extracts and toppings can easily change up a basic meringue recipe. Use pure extract like rose, peppermint, or hazelnut, or replace the vanilla extract with the seeds of whole vanilla beans. Sift cocoa powder or cinnamon into finished meringue, or fold in ground pistachios, chopped chocolate, freeze-dried fruit, or coconut flakes before baking. To color meringue, use gel food coloring. <br> Be sure not to go overboard with the extra flavorings \u2014 especially liquids. Meringue are meant to be light, simple treats, and too much of any additional ingredient may break down the meringue before it bakes. ",

        "<br> Late summer nights call for easy food that is also fresh and vibrant, abundant with tomatoes, herbs, and other garden booty. This skillet is the dish I make when I want a 15-minute meal with just a handful of ingredients, but one that tastes like summer in the mouth. <br> Gnocchi, blistered cherry tomatoes, chicken sausage, and a handful of basil \u2014 look, I\u2019ve told you the whole ingredient list already. <br> I am such a fan of gnocchi in the summertime. Their fat-bellied shapes hold their own with juicy tomatoes and other vegetables; it\u2019s so fun to spear a thumbprint of gnocchi with a piece of sausage and tomato in this dish. It fits perfectly in the mouth, no trailing pasta to manage. <br> And while you can certainly make your own gnocchi, store-bought works just fine here. I usually opt for gnocchi that needs a quick cook, but you can also buy pre-cooked gnocchi that\u2019s all ready to throw into the skillet. <br> For sausage, use whatever you like. I use pre-cooked chicken sausage, and I vary the flavors \u2014 this time I used jalape\u00f1o for a little sizzle, but I have also used garlic, Asiago, and other delicious sausage varieties. <br> Last but not least, I finish this with basil, not cheese. You\u2019re welcome to use Parmesan, if you like, but in the summer I try to resist the temptation to finish off every Italianesque dish with Parm; let the tomatoes and basil star here. ",

        "<br> Winter produce can start to feel tired almost as soon as winter fully sets in. But roasted vegetable boredom usually leads me to experimentation and, if I\u2019m lucky, occasional breakthroughs, like these roasted carrots with orange. <br> Storage carrots \u2014 dense and super orange compared to their younger counterparts with leaves still attached \u2014 are an affordable winter staple. The sweetness of carrots in a savory recipe can be challenging, so I tossed my carrots with a generous sprinkle of chili powder and orange slivers. Just as with other produce, roasting deepens the flavor of oranges; the rind is at once crispy, buttery, and the good kind of bitter, while the sweet flesh caramelizes into the carrots, transforming a familiar lineup into something unexpected, flavorful, and fun. <br> The hint of bitterness in a roasted orange rind might not be for everyone; the bitter-averse can toss the carrots with four orange slices instead of little slivers, and fish them out before serving.

        "<br> Honey is a sweet friend to pork, made famous by the ubiquitous honey-baked Easter ham. The trouble with a ham is that it\u2019s big enough to be a burden in a small kitchen. (Some people contend that eternity is one ham and two people.) A tenderloin, however, makes just enough for two to four servings, and still makes one fine Sunday dinner. <br> The best thing about pork tenderloin is that it is very lean and cooks quickly. The <br>trickiest<br> thing about pork tenderloin is that it is very lean and cooks quickly. <br> Because it turns drab and dry when overcooked, the secret to juicy roasted pork is to trust an instant-read thermometer to gauge doneness instead of guessing or following the advice in older cookbooks that insist it\u2019s risky to eat pork that isn\u2019t well-done and gray. We\u2019re wiser now, and understand that tenderloin cooked to a safe 145\u00b0F to 150\u00b0F might be a tad rosy in the center, but the juices will show no traces of pink. For an accurate reading, insert the thermometer horizontally through the end of the cylindrical tenderloin; this cut of pork is so slender that it\u2019s hard to pinpoint the center when pierced from the top or side. <br> <br>Read more: <br>USDA Lowers Temperature Guidelines for Cooking Pork<br> <br> The bear-shaped squeeze-bottle of honey will work if it\u2019s all you have on hand, but this recipe (especially when made with premium pastured pork or served for Easter) deserves superb local honey \u2014 perhaps acacia or wildflower, or even sourwood or chestnut if you prefer a bolder, earthier flavor. The heat from the cracked black and cayenne pepper tempers the sweetness. I suggest serving this recipe with biscuits or yeast rolls to sop up all of the amazing glaze. <br> <br> Read more:<br> <br>What to Know About Honey Color, Varietals, and Finding a Honey You Really Love<br> ",

Vegetarian versions, called ph\u1edf chay, may be found at Buddhist establishments or restaurants catering to contemporary, Western clientele but, sadly, these often leave much to be desired. <br> In the interest of making vegetarian ph\u1edf at home, I consulted my mother, who recalled her experience living in a Vietnamese Buddhist community that made meat-free ph\u1edf broth with a medley of spices, ginger, and lots of carrots. This recipe is my interpretation. While it admittedly lacks the richness of meat-based ph\u1edf, it\u2019s still quite fragrant and filling without being heavy. There\u2019s also room to make it your own by adding different proteins or vegetables. I continue to work on perfecting the broth, so let me know what you think! <br> Even though we\u2019re edging our way into warmer weather, I could eat this comforting soup all summer long. <br> One of the things I love about this pho is that it\u2019s sort of like a make-your-own-adventure recipe. The noodles and broth are a staple. But beyond that it\u2019s up to you to choose toppings \u2014 like tofu, seitan, mushrooms, and greens \u2014 as well as a lengthy list of optional garnishes. Choose as many or as few as you like. <br> Normally when given the option of toppings, I like to go all in. The more toppings, the merrier. This vegetarian pho is an exception, though. The broth, which picks up great flavor from the spices, a slight sweetness from the carrots, and the subtlest of charred aromas from the onion and ginger, is what truly makes this soup for me. I prefer keeping the toppings to a minimum so I can let the broth stand out and take center stage. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Kelli<br>, May 2015<br> ",

        "<br> A great sheet pan meal can feel like a minor miracle: throw everything on one pan, put it into the oven, and voila \u2014 happy dinnertime. We\u2019ve given you an <br>essential method for roasting chicken and vegetables together on one pan<br>. But let\u2019s take that to the next level \u2014 here\u2019s one of our favorite flavor combination of chicken, little red potatoes, and herbs. <br> Skin-on chicken thighs offer the best chicken-y taste per bite of any cut \u2014 all the flavor of dark meat without the extra cooking time. <br> In our <br>standard sheet pan chicken recipe <br>we heat the pan in the oven before adding the chicken thighs. That recipe includes small red potatoes and broccoli \u2014 which cook in the fat render by the chicken thighs, no additional drizzle required. <br> In this rendition of sheet pan chicken, we\u2019re riffing on that technique and adding some additional fat into the equation to aid in crisping up the sage leaves and scallions. The magic of chicken fat is still at work though. The fat renders gently and bathes the small potatoes, transforming them into something special. At the last minute, a broiling blast makes the skin a crispy delight. Just make sure to use the heaviest sheet pan in your arsenal for this recipe \u2014 one that will stand up to broiling. ",

I was traveling to Los Angeles frequently for work and discovering the pleasures of wildly spicy and tangy <br>laap<br>, the pan-fried noodle flavors of <br>pad kee mow<br>, and the sweet relief of creamy Thai tea. The flavors sang, intense and heightened \u2014 all new to this Midwestern girl. <br> Back home I had a friend, Joe, who was Thai and who brought curries and noodle dishes to weekend dinners with friends. It was Joe who offered me my first glimpse into how these dishes were built. It was tantalizing and fun \u2014 a delicious way to understand what my Thai, Indian, and Chinese friends wanted to eat; and how, ultimately, one dish, like green curry, can be something new that wakes you up, then something that you learn by teasing it out like a knot, and then, after you\u2019ve learned it by heart, continues to be a point of connection that ties you with your past and your present. <br> Green curry wasn\u2019t just the dish that got me into cooking in earnest (and for that it would have to fight it out with <br>laap <br>and great bolognese and also South Indian pork vindaloo). It was also the dish, it turned out, that happened to be a favorite of my now-husband, a man I met on one of those trips to Los Angeles, and who ended up following me back to Ohio, where \u2014 I am sorry to say \u2014 the average quality of Thai restaurants simply does not match up to Los Angeles. But not many places do. <br> So Joe\u2019s green curry became one of those dinners that I carried straight on into a new household and a new life, with a guy who still gets very romantic about the fact I can make spicy curry at the drop of a hat. And every time I make it I remember Los Angeles, before we got to know each other over mouth-numbing seafood and noodles at places like Sanamluang and Yai Thai, and before I knew you could make good green curry at home. <br> But you can, and while I enjoy the authentic processes of cooking Thai from scratch \u2014 see <br>my review of <br>Pok Pok<br> to see just how committed I can be \u2014 there\u2019s a lot to be said for opening up a couple cans and making fabulous curry in 20 minutes. That\u2019s what happens here. In fact, this recipe calls for fewer ingredients than almost anything else I make. <br> You open a can of good green curry paste, found at almost any Asian grocery and even in some grocery stores, not to mention <br>Amazon<br>, and saut\u00e9 it with a little oil. Then add coconut milk and chicken, and simmer. There you have it: green curry. <br> For the curry paste I usually buy the Maesri brand, which is in little green cans you can find at your local Asian grocery. Good-quality coconut milk is important, too; I like the Thai Chaokoh brand. <br> I also like to add cuttlefish balls, which are chewy, savory balls made out of pressed squid. (Find them in the frozen section of the Asian grocery.) They add a slightly funky, fishy element to the curry that I really like, but they\u2019re completely optional \u2014 you can leave them out. <br> And finally, this recipe is easily adaptable to vegetarians \u2014 just use the zucchini and leave out the meat and fish, or add some fried tofu squares at the end. Or skip the zucchini and use what Joe always used \u2014 the small round eggplants you can find at Indian or Chinese grocery stores. I use zucchini because it\u2019s more accessible, but either will be delicious in this sauce. <br> I made this again last weekend and took it to a gathering of friends. Joe and his family moved back to Chiang Mai a few years ago, but many of our mutual friends have stayed here. After my friends and my husband raided the curry, scooping out almost every bite, I took a photo of the lone remaining fish ball and the last of sauce, and sent it to Joe: \u201cSongsdhit here is your green curry \u2014 once again the hit of the party.\u201d ",

        "<br> I am a born-and-bred Southerner who surely spent at least one past life in Italy. I am deeply devoted to both Southern and Italian cuisines and am convinced they have the same soul. <br> I often apply the techniques of one to the ingredients of the other. That explains why I make my Hoppin\u2019 John \u2014 an iconic Southern dish \u2014 like risotto, creating a large pot of creamy rice and field peas studded with sausage. To continue the theme, I top each serving with a heaping spoonful of collard pesto. <br> Although we often think of pesto as made only from basil, it comes in many forms, such as this delicious version made from collards. It\u2019s perfect with the Hoppin\u2019 John risotto, but it can be served in any way you\u2019d serve any other pesto. Collard pesto holds its vibrant color for days. <br> The collards should be small and tender, about the size of an outstretched hand. If the only collards you can find are larger, they must be extremely fresh with good color, pliant leaves, and clean edges. If you cannot find fresh collards of any size, use fresh Tuscan kale (aka black kale, dinosaur kale, or lacinato kale) instead. No type of frozen greens will work in this recipe. <br> Don\u2019t skip the collard pesto; it\u2019s heavenly and pulls the dish together. <br> <br>Sheri Castle<br> is an award-winning food writer, recipe developer, recipe tester, and culinary instructor.

The entire process should take about 25 minutes.",

        "How To Make a Dutch Baby Pancake",
        "<br> Dutch baby pancakes are like a hybrid (or a love child, if you will) of a pancake, a crepe, and a popover \u2014 all in one giant skillet. It feels like a party trick, but for the breakfast crowd. I break these out whenever anyone in my house needs a little extra delight in their day. <br> Start with a thin, pancake-like batter and a hot skillet. Pour the batter into the skillet all at once and slide it into a hot oven. Within a few minutes, the batter will start to puff around the edges, rising higher and higher until this \u201cpancake\u201d looks more like a poofy pillow. Once those edges turn golden and you can\u2019t resist the sweet aroma of baked goods any longer, it\u2019s ready. <br> Out of the oven, the Dutch baby will quickly collapse back into the pan \u2014 the steam holding it up quickly evaporates in the cooler air of your kitchen. But no bother \u2014 what\u2019s left behind is a pancake with the soft, tender texture of a hot crepe and the eggy flavor of a sweet popover. Slice it into wedges and smear each slice with some jam and maple syrup as you serve it up. <br> I\u2019ve picked up a few Dutch baby tricks over the years and have gradually brought them together into a single recipe. First, use a blender or food processor to make a very smooth batter with no lumps. Then, rest the batter to give the flour a chance to absorb the liquid, which gives the pancake a better texture and less flour-y flavor. And finally, use a hot skillet to help the pancake puff. You\u2019ll get some crunchy, caramelized edges this way. <br> Be sure to use a 9- or 10-inch skillet for making this pancake. The smaller size helps increase the puff and helps the pancake keep its shape. The pan doesn\u2019t have to be cast iron; you can use any oven-safe pan or baking dish of a similar size. I\u2019ve even done them in a pie dish! <br> I usually carry the pan to the table, dust it with powdered sugar, and serve it right there. Put a bunch of different toppings on the table and let everyone choose for themselves: Nutella, jams and preserves, lemon curd, peanut butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, and any other little jars you\u2019d like to use up from the fridge. <br> Served on its own, I think this Dutch baby makes a good size for two adults to split. If you\u2019re serving it alongside a full breakfast spread of eggs, toast, and potatoes, slice it into more wedges so everyone gets a piece. You can also double or triple the amount of batter and make a few Dutch babies in the oven at once. Any leftovers make a fantastic snack later in the day. ",

To get closer to the original, add seafood or fried sausage to the pot towards the end of the cooking time. <br> Even if you don\u2019t have six people to serve, make the whole pot and use the leftovers in burritos the next day or warm it up with a fried egg on top. If you\u2019re really ambitious, you can even form the leftovers into little cakes and pan-fry them on the stovetop to make jambalaya patties. <br> <br>Meal <br>Cost<br>: $3.90 total, or $0.65 per person (with additions, will come to closer to $8 total) <br> I love classic Southern dishes and was drawn to this lightened-up, vegetable-heavy version of jambalaya. Even though this jambalaya doesn\u2019t have a long cooking time, it had a lot of delicious, slow-cooked flavor. I liked the added flexibility of bulking it up with sausage, shrimp, or beans. I added half a can of black beans and thought it was quite tasty! <br> \u2013<br> <br>Christine<br>, August 2015<br> ",

        "Recipe: Tofu Chickpea Stir-Fry with Tahini Sauce",
        "<br> When I mention that I develop vegetarian recipes, the most frequent reply is, \u201cYou must eat a lot of tofu!\u201d However, I am actually a late adopter of tofu. I\u2019m a texture person, and I\u2019ve only recently found ways to prepare tofu that are not only easy, but also result in a great taste and texture. In this recipe for tofu and chickpea stir-fry with its creamy tahini sauce, you\u2019ll find all of the above. <br> I like <br>baking the tofu<br> even when I\u2019m going to be adding it to a stir-fry. Baking helps crisp up the outside while keeping the inside soft and tender. Add a few extra minutes in a wok with hot oil, it only gets better. Plus, baking the tofu seals in the marinated flavor, giving the tofu depth before adding it to the stir fry. If you don\u2019t have time to bake your own, look for packages of baked tofu in the refrigerated section of the grocery store. <br> While the tofu is the star of the show, do not discount the tahini sauce. I could easily eat a vegetable noodle bowl smothered with the sauce every day of the week. Peanut butter is nice, but the unique flavor of sesame works wonders when paired with soy sauce and ginger.

        "<br> Like many of you, I grew up eating pot roast on a (very) regular basis. And while I will always love my mother\u2019s old-school version, I felt it was time for a little upgrade. I\u2019ve nixed the \u201cpantry helpers\u201d and replaced them with Dijon mustard, maple, and balsamic for delicious take on a classic. <br> My mom, a busy wife and mother of three, adhered to a strict weekly dinner rotation consisting of \u201cnew American\u201d classics. Her repertoire of recipes was quick, consistent, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 didn\u2019t stir up complaints from the peanut gallery. She made no apologies about using convenience products to get food on the table, nor should she have. To this day, the mere thought of her cheesy chicken spaghetti and creamy beef stroganoff rouses a deep urge to be transported back to my youth. <br> Pot roast and potatoes were a Sunday night tradition, and to this day, my mom\u2019s recipe is still my gold standard. (Its not-so-secret secret? Lipton\u2019s onion soup mix.) In all honesty, I\u2019ve never attempted her pot roast in my kitchen \u2014 I guess it\u2019s one of those memories I felt was better left alone. That said, all this Arctic weather of late has kept the old one-pot wonder on my mind. So I brushed off my dusty slow cooker \u2014 lonely from its creaky attic shelf \u2014 but instead of reaching for my mother\u2019s recipe binder, I decided to create a new pot roast tradition to call my very own. <br> This recipe uses my favorite cast of characters to create a rich yet homey dish. I\u2019ve eaten one too many pot roasts on the drier side, so my goal was a buttery, falling-apart piece of meat. The slow cooker is the ideal candidate for the job; low heat for a long time makes this recipe melt-in-your mouth delicious. And while my mom always cooked potatoes and carrots along with the meat, I wanted something a little more dressed up. Creamy stone-ground grits provide a perfect foil for the savory gravy, while maple-roasted carrots add just a hint of sweet. It may not be the same pot roast of my childhood, but I think my mom will approve. ",

        "<br> When I first made this recipe, it was January, which means we were all craving food that is a little lighter, a little healthier, and a little more in line with the way we\u2019ve resolved to eat this year. But at the same time, <br>it was January \u2014 <br>when we\u2019re wrapped up in sweaters and blankets, it\u2019s comfort food we\u2019re dreaming about. <br> That\u2019s where this recipe comes in. With its rich, mushroom-studded filling tucked under a layer of soft mashed sweet potato, it has all the hallmarks of a good shepherd\u2019s pie, but it\u2019s completely vegan \u2014 and includes a secret ingredient that adds body and creaminess to the filling, without any cream. <br> Authentic shepherd\u2019s pie is a comfort food classic, but there\u2019s no room in my diet or grocery budget for a heavy dish of ground lamb or beef and buttery potatoes, except as an occasional treat. Lentils and mushrooms are more my speed, and sweet potatoes, roasted until creamy-soft, need just a little salt and pepper to be a flavorful topping. <br> This recipe uses one unusual ingredient: steel cut oats! The dry oats \u2014 cooked and drained with the lentils \u2014 release just enough starch to bind the filling into a creamy, mushroomy mass, rather than a loose scattering of lentils and vegetables. The oats also add a texture somewhat like ground meat, but they aren\u2019t noticeable unless you know to look for them, so your guests will have no idea their dinner includes a nutritious breakfast staple. <br> Speaking of guests, this recipe is an ideal dinner party dish for vegan or vegetarian eaters. It\u2019s hearty, full of umami flavor, and looks and feels like a proper main dish, rather than a vegetable side dish that received a promotion. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s only for those who can\u2019t eat the meat version \u2014 I\u2019ve served it to omnivorous guests and my meat-loving husband with great success. ",

        "<br> This dish might not win any beauty contests, but I\u2019ll say this: it\u2019s seriously good. The tortillas get soft and chewy during cooking, absorbing some of the salsa and becoming the perfect vehicle for beans, corns, and lots of melted cheese. (And isn\u2019t it all about the melty cheese, really?) <br> These slow cooker enchiladas are one of my go-to meals when I\u2019m out of ideas and have some bits and leftovers to use up, and they always hit the spot. <br> I also like that this is a classic dump-and-cook slow-cooker recipe. It only requires you to mix the filling and roll up the tortillas before plugging in the cooker and walking away. The onions soften during cooking and the flavors have plenty of time to meld. It\u2019s perfect for times when I don\u2019t want to dirty a lot of dishes or deal with an extra step of pre-cooking vegetables. <br> These enchiladas are a personal favorite. They\u2019re not the kind of thing I\u2019d serve to guests \u2014 things get a bit messy and less-than-photogenic when served from the slow cooker \u2014 but they are <br>most definitely<br> the kind of thing I adore eating when it\u2019s just me, my husband, and a good movie to watch on the couch. <br> Some of you who\u2019ve made this recipe over the years describe it as \u201cmushy but delicious,\u201d and I have to agree with that assessment. Using tortillas that are a few days old and a little stale helps with this situation, and flour tortillas hold up better than corn tortillas. But, to be completely honest, I kind of love that slightly mushy, chewy quality! It sounds like such a negative, I know, but this feels like comfort food to me. These enchiladas are the perfect meal to scoop onto a plate and take to the couch. From your comments and feedback, I know many of you agree! <br> On the other hand, if you\u2019d prefer more classic enchiladas (and I respect that), I recommend baking this recipe in the oven instead of the slow cooker. There are instructions for this at the end of the recipe below. <br> Either way, I do hope you enjoy this recipe. Pick a night when the weather keeps you inside and you have a good movie that\u2019s waiting to be watched. Enjoy! <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Emma<br>, March 2015<br> ",

        "Recipe: Potato, Squash & Goat Cheese Gratin",
        "<br> This is an easy, rustic recipe that makes a great <br>vegetarian meal<br> or a pretty side dish for summer or autumn. It\u2019s so simple: yellow squash layered in a jumble with sliced red potato and goat cheese. No cream needed at all. <br> For this gratin, I didn\u2019t bother layering the vegetables in a pretty scalloped pattern. I practically threw the potato and squash slices in the pan, all mixed up together. Tastes the same, right? <br> The only complicated part is slicing the vegetables paper-thin. I love my <br>mandoline<br> for this (they\u2019re not expensive, and we highly recommend one for so many dishes), but if you don\u2019t have one, you\u2019ll just need a bit more time and a very sharp knife. <br> There\u2019s not a ton of cheese and no cream (just a splash of milk to keep it tender), so the fresh taste of the vegetables is front and center. We sprinkled our gratin with basil at the end for a little color. It was a near-perfect dinner \u2014 and the leftovers tasted great. <br> This classic and simple recipe from Elizabeth has always received rave reviews from our readers and commenters, and I finally had a chance to try it last week. I was shocked by how quickly it came together. I sliced up the squash and potatoes on my mandoline, just as Elizabeth advises, and jumbled them higgledy-piggledy in a casserole dish. When baked, they were tender and soft, but they still tasted vibrant and fresh \u2014 unlike vegetables in gratins that are swimming in cheese and cream. This was a keeper. I can hardly wait to make it again. <br> \u2013 <br>Faith<br>, September 2012<br> ",

        "<br> If you\u2019ve never experienced the magic that is <br>spaghetti squash<br>, this is the recipe to kick off your new obsession. It\u2019s called <br>spaghetti<br> squash for a reason, after all, and these tender strands of squash make a remarkable stand-in for our favorite pasta dishes. <br> Today, this mild-tasting squash is getting a lasagna makeover. Mozzarella, ricotta, meat sauce \u2014 the works. It\u2019s a bowl of hot-baked goodness that you get all to yourself, no sharing required. <br> I won\u2019t lie to you: spaghetti squash is really not the same as actual spaghetti. You won\u2019t be able to fool yourself or your family members into thinking they\u2019re eating the real thing. <br> But spaghetti squash has its own merits! It\u2019s very mild-tasting \u2014 none of that \u201csquashy\u201d flavor that some folks don\u2019t like. It also has a very unique texture that\u2019s easy to love. Where most squashes get very soft after cooking, strands of spaghetti squash become tender, but stay distinct. In a sauce like this one, they add heartiness and substance without screaming \u201csquash!\u201d <br> This recipe uses two medium-sized spaghetti squashes to make four very generous servings. Come hungry. You can also make this in a 2-quart casserole dish; you lose the fun of eating from a squash, but it makes smaller serving sizes and dealing with leftovers a little easier. Everything can be prepped and assembled the night before you plan to eat, just increase the time in the oven to give the refrigerated fillings time to warm through. <br> Whether you\u2019re aim is more veggies or fewer carbs or just a new go-to recipe for your weekly meal plan, this recipe is a sure bet.

        "<br> I am not a holiday food purist. When my family switched our eating habits, we carried our love of vegetables and whole grains into the holidays as well. At first, the other members of my extended family were hesitant, but after a few years, they realized that while the food was heavily loaded with vegetables, it was still delicious. These simple sweet potatoes would easily grace our table during the holidays. <br> Now, however, these potatoes are a treat only for me. After moving to California, my husband and I realized going home to Illinois for Thanksgiving and Christmas became too much, so we spend a quiet day by ourselves on Thanksgiving. Don\u2019t be fooled though \u2014 my husband still wants the Thanksgiving food he grew up with (read: not homemade green bean casserole). It\u2019s the one time of year I oblige his wishes and make him what he wants. <br> I still will treat myself to a vegetable-heavy meal: roasted Brussels sprouts, butternut squash casserole, and sweet potatoes in one form or another. I really enjoy these Hasselback sweet potatoes for their simplicity and ease. (Once you get good at the cutting, that is. I\u2019m forever accidentally cutting them in half! Note the chopstick trick in the recipe instructions \u2014 it\u2019s a potato saver.) <br> I stick with thyme as the seasoning, but you could add whichever herbs you might have on hand from the rest of your meal. Rosemary, chives, and sage would make good additions or replacements, and if you don\u2019t want to mess with the brown butter, you could use a drizzle of good olive oil \u2014 though the brown butter does add a nice touch of flavor!

        "How To Make a Cinnamon Roll Wreath",
        "<br> Never let it be said that I passed up a chance to go all out. Give me a few overnight guests, a lazy weekend morning, and a request for cinnamon rolls, and I will present this cinnamon roll wreath, complete with extra frosting on the side. <br> How can this glorious specimen of breakfast delight be yours? Glad you asked. <br> You can use any cinnamon roll recipe that you like here \u2014 or even recipes for sticky buns, sweet buns, or any other kind of filled breakfast roll. Any recipe that will give you a log of dough roughly 15 inches long once rolled up will work quite nicely. I used our Kitchn recipe for <br>Spicy, Sticky Cinnamon Rolls<br>. <br> No need to be precise here; it\u2019s more about the technique of making the wreath than the actual recipe. (Heads up if you use our recipe: This recipe makes a rather long 25-inch log, which I cut in half to make two separate wreaths.) <br> <br>\u2192 Get the Recipe: <br>Spicy, Sticky Cinnamon Rolls<br> <br> I tried making the wreath two ways: coiling and then cutting, and then again cutting first and then coiling. I was much happier with the second wreath \u2014 it\u2019s easier to make thinner rolls and get more space between each roll. Not only is this prettier, but it means more rolls for the grabbing. <br> The basic idea is to lay the log of prepared dough on the parchment-lined baking sheet and then cut it into fairly thin, 1-inch-thick rolls \u2014 but don\u2019t cut all the way through. Leave the rolls connected by a little bit of dough at the bottom. Then start laying the rolls flat on the baking sheet, overlapping each one over the next, and coiling the log into a circular wreath as you go. Tuck the last roll under the first, and you\u2019re done. <br> Put a ramekin or other round, oven-safe dish in the middle of the wreath. This helps the wreath keep its shape as the rolls rise and bake. Remove the ramekin before serving, or flip it right-side up and fill it with frosting for dipping! <br> As much as I love giving my houseguests an impressive morning feast, I also love my sleep. I am a big fan of making and shaping the wreath the night before and putting the whole sheet pan in the fridge overnight. Let the rolls warm as the oven preheats and then bake as usual \u2014 you may need to add on an extra minute or two to the baking time to account for the chilled dough. <br> You can also par-bake the wreath and then freeze it for a few weeks \u2014 this is handy if you end up making two wreaths and want to save the second one for later. <br> <br>\u2192 Read More: <br>How to Freeze Cinnamon Rolls and Bake Them Later<br> <br> ",

        "<br> As the perfect snack food, popcorn works as a flavor delivery system with an <br>endless number of ways to customize it.<br> But around the holidays, a few flavors stand out as favorites. <br> If you love the mixed tins of caramel and cheddar popcorn, known as the classic Windy City blend, give this mix a try at home \u2014 and even give it as a homemade edible gift. The sweet crackle of caramel corn is the perfect foil to intensely cheesy popcorn. You\u2019ve got to get both in a bite to really experience the joy of these two opposites coming together for such a rich, crunchy treat. <br> Chicago-style popcorn brings together the best parts of those tall popcorn tins \u2014 the orange-dusted cheddar popcorn and sweet caramel-coated popcorn \u2014 in one bowl, bag, or handful. This gift-worthy snack food does not believe in separation. Each bite takes your tastebuds on a journey of sweet, salty, cheesy, and buttery flavors. <br> So what exactly does Chicago have to do with this sweet and savory popcorn blend? There\u2019s much debate about where exactly this caramel and cheddar popcorn duo originated. Some argue <br>Garrett Popcorn Shops<br> was the creator, while others stand by <br>G.H. Cretors<br>. What we do know for sure is that it hails from the city of Chicago, hence the name, and we\u2019ve been smitten with the unique combo ever since. ",

        "Recipe: Slow Cooker Chicken in Milk",
        "<br> British chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s recipe for chicken braised in milk has made the rounds here at Kitchn, and we all agree <br>it is absolutely divine<br>. It\u2019s a recipe that takes some trust (cook a whole chicken in <br>milk<br>?), but trust you should \u2014 the results more than speak for themselves. <br> This lemony, sage-infused chicken with its incredible golden sauce has become a perennial visitor to my autumn menus, and this year, I decided to take it to the slow cooker. Here\u2019s my riff on the original \u2014 same tender chicken, now with even more hands-off time. <br> <br>Read More: <br>Jamie Oliver\u2019s Chicken in Milk Is Probably the Best Chicken Recipe of All Time<br> <br> Switching this recipe from the Dutch oven to the slow cooker is practically seamless. The cooking methods are nearly identical, so making it in the slow cooker primarily means extending the cooking time. Jamie Oliver cooks his chicken with the lid removed, but we at The Kitchn have discovered we actually prefer it with the lid on \u2014 just like in a slow cooker. <br> I would normally reduce the amount of liquid for a slow cooker recipe, but that golden sauce you get at the end is so dang good that I decided to let it ride. (And FYI, I did not regret this decision.) <br> No, the biggest debate I had in converting this recipe was actually whether or not to sear the chicken before putting it in the slow cooker. I\u2019m a big fan of slow cooker recipes that let you throw it all in the pot and walk away, so I was tempted to do away with the searing step altogether. But when I brought this up at Kitchn HQ, our Editor in Chief, Faith, argued that the deep, caramelized flavor from searing the chicken and scraping the browned bits from the pan are actually a crucial flavor component to this otherwise fairly simple dish. After much soul searching, I finally decided that I agree. <br> This led me to make one addition to Jamie\u2019s recipe that \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 I think actually improves upon the original. After searing the chicken to a deeply pleasing shade of golden-brown, I deglazed the pan with some hard cider and poured it over the chicken in the slow cooker. Wammo! This touch of apple sweetness really puts the special in the special sauce here, and I think I\u2019ll adopt this change even when I make the oven version. <br> If you\u2019ve never made this recipe before, you might be alarmed at the condition of the cooking liquid when you lift the lid. The milk, which helps make the chicken oh-so-tender, will split and curdle during cooking, and the finished sauce can look less than appealing. I encourage you to embrace the ugly. Those curds are heavenly, as is the golden liquid in which they are swimming. <br> If the idea is just a bit too unappetizing for you, I understand \u2014 strain the curds and serve the liquid by itself alongside your plates of chicken. Save any leftover sauce for adding to soups or cooking grains. ",

        "How To Make Slow Cooker French Dip Sandwiches",
        "<br> I remember almost nothing about my first visit to Philippe\u2019s restaurant in Los Angeles except for the most important thing: the French dip sandwiches. Before going, this Midwestern girl didn\u2019t even know what a French dip was. But after that first encounter, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much of a hyperbole to say that I was completely smitten. <br> A few years back, Nealey shared with us her homemade version of <br>Philippe\u2019s French dip sandwich<br>, but for a recent dinner party with friends, I was looking for a shortcut option. And thus, these slow cooker French dips were born. <br> This is a sandwich that rises above all others. Beef is slowly roasted until completely tender, then sliced thinly and tossed with some of the cooking juices. The bun is just as important; white and squishy French rolls are ideal. They get toasted and then dribbled with (or dipped in) more of the cooking juices. Pile the meat on top and add a slice of cheese, and you\u2019ve got a French dip sandwich. Don\u2019t forget the \u201cjus\u201d on the side for dipping. <br> There is much debate about who invented the first French dip, but my loyalty will stay with Philippe\u2019s. If you are ever in Los Angeles, I recommend making a special stop around lunchtime. <br> <br>Visit the Restaurant: <br>Phillipe: Home of the Original French Dipped Sandwich<br> <br> I won\u2019t claim that this is a true French dip sandwich \u2014 it\u2019s really more of a <br>pot roast<br> that\u2019s served in the style of French dip. But let\u2019s not quibble \u2014 these are too good for that. <br> In the slow cooker, the beef becomes so tender that it struggles to hold together and both the broth and the beef become fully infused with flavor during the slow simmer. The onions also aren\u2019t traditional to a French dip, but in this recipe, they help give the broth a savory-sweet depth. Pull them out and use them for another dish, if you like, or buck tradition and pile them on top of your sandwich. <br> I also love this technique I learned from <br>Carlsbad Cravings<br> for cooking the roast partway, slicing it, and then returning it to the slow cooker. It\u2019s easier to slice the beef at this stage, before it\u2019s so tender that it falls apart, and the finished slices are also juicier and more flavorful from their simmering time in the broth. This said, if you won\u2019t be around during the day to slice the beef, you can skip this step and either cut or shred the meat at the end. <br> I love slow-cooker recipes where you can just throw everything in the pot and walk away, but with this one, I think it\u2019s worth the time to sear the meat before cooking. Think of it as an added-value moment. Searing adds a deeply savory, roasted flavor to both the meat itself and the broth. It also gives the sandwich more of a traditional roasted look. ",

        "Recipe: Chicken Lentil Soup",
        "<br> For me, especially when I\u2019m focusing on my health or losing weight, there is nothing more comforting than having many containers of this nourishing, delicious, filling lentil soup with chicken stashed away in the freezer. Lentil soup is actually the very first dish I learned to cook, and I am still amazed at how easy it is to make something so much better than you get from a can. I\u2019m also sentimental about this soup, so it will probably always be among my favorite things to make. <br> I do prefer using bacon fat here. I spend extra on premium bacon so I always strain and save the rendered fat for making this soup. The smoky flavor it brings to the soup is a great complement to the earthy lentils, but butter and olive oil also work well. <br> <br>Get a recipe: <br>How To Make Perfect Bacon in the Oven<br> <br> For a vegetarian version, just leave out the chicken and bacon fat (use olive oil instead). I\u2019ve made it that way many times. The shredded chicken just adds a meaty texture and an extra dose of protein. ",

            "Heat the bacon fat, butter, or olive oil in the bottom of a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic. Season the vegetables well with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to coat the vegetables. Cook until the tomato paste darkens and sticks a bit to the bottom of the pot, about 2 minutes more.",
            "Add the chicken broth or water and lentils and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and add the chicken. Cover and continue cooking for 1 hour, checking periodically to make sure the soup isn't bubbling too vigorously. Transfer the chicken thighs to a plate to cool.",
            "Working in batches, blend about half of the lentil soup until it's thick and creamy. (You can blend all of it if you like a creamy lentil soup, or none of it if you want it completely broth-y. I like it somewhere in the middle.) Stir the pur\u00e9ed soup back into the pot. Using 2 forks, shred the chicken and return it to the pot. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with cheese sprinkled over the top if desired."

        "<br> Every single holiday season, without fail, this happens: I get a deep craving for eggnog, resist until I can\u2019t resist any longer, buy a carton, pour myself a small glass, and find satisfaction in just a few sips. The problem is I leave myself with the majority of the carton left over after I\u2019ve fulfilled my craving. What the heck do I do with all the rest? <br> That\u2019s when I end up scouring the internet for recipes using the remainder. Here\u2019s the recipe I\u2019ll now turn to. This French toast casserole not only tastes of the holidays, but it\u2019s also a make-ahead dish that\u2019s a welcome addition to your breakfast roaster this time of year. <br> This casserole has all the rich, custardy goodness that classic French toast has, but it\u2019s geared to serve a crowd. Assemble it the night before you\u2019re expecting hungry mouths to feed at the breakfast table. Then all you have to do it toss it in the oven in the morning. A glug of bourbon enhances the eggnog flavor of the dish, but vanilla is a great substitute if you\u2019d rather avoid it. Just don\u2019t forget the dusting of cinnamon and powdered sugar on top before bringing this to the table \u2014 it is the holidays, after all! ",

        "How To Decorate Cookies with Icing: The Simplest, Easiest Method",
        "<br> If you covet those glossy, perfectly iced sugar cookies but don\u2019t feel like your pastry skills are quite up to par enough to do it yourself, we\u2019re here to help. You don\u2019t need any special ingredients or equipment. Skip the meringue powder, the pastry bags, and the piping tips. Embrace your lazy inner baker. This is the simplest, most straight-forward way to decorate cookies with icing. <br> I am here to tell you that it\u2019s entirely possible and perfectly legit to decorate cookies with a simple icing of powdered sugar and milk using squeeze bottles in place of piping bags. There are some advantages to using the traditional royal icing, which I\u2019ll talk about below, but for most of us home bakers \u2014 those of us who just want some pretty cookies to share with our friends and family \u2014 plain ol\u2019 sugar icing works just fine. <br> This is a two-step process. First you make a slightly thicker icing, called \u201cborder icing,\u201d and use this to trace the outline around your cookie. Then you make a slightly looser icing, called \u201cflood icing,\u201d and fill in the area in the middle of the cookie. The border icing will work as a barrier to hold in the more liquidy flood icing, creating a completely smooth layer of icing over the cookie. <br> You can color your border and flood icing with food coloring. I like plain white borders and vibrant centers, but you could color the border and the flood icing with the same color or use contrasting colors. You can also draw designs inside the cookies using either the border icing or by dropping a contrasting color of flood icing over the the cookie after you\u2019ve finished flooding it. <br> I find that squeeze bottles work just as well as piping bags for decorating and are easier for us non-pro bakers to work with. Plus, they\u2019re easy to clean! My favorites are little eight-ounce squeeze bottles that you can find at Michael\u2019s and other craft stores. A small funnel makes it easy to fill them. The thicker border icing sometimes needs a little coaxing to get into the bottle \u2014 squeezing the bottle creates some suction that will help pull the icing into the bottle (check out the photos in the slideshow). <br> <br>My favorite squeeze bottles: <br>Wilton Mini Squeeze Bottles<br> from Amazon<br> <br> Royal icing is what professional bakers typically use for this kind of cookie decorating. It\u2019s made with either whipped egg whites or whipped meringue powder along with powdered sugar and water, and it tends to be a little more stable and thicker than straight powdered sugar icing. <br> Royal icing is great for fine-detailed decorating work and Martha Stewart, but for the most part, I\u2019m just not that fancy. I am totally happy with a cookie simply flooded with a layer of crunchy, sugary icing. I also like the fact that straight powdered sugar icing can be made with a fork and bowl in just a few seconds and doesn\u2019t require any disclaimers about raw eggs when sharing the resulting cookies. <br> These cookies might not be quite what the pros would go for, but for friends and family, these fuss-free, homemade, hand-iced sugar cookies are a credit to the cookie tray. <br> If you are curious about royal icing, here are a few recipes and tutorials about working with it. <br> Thin, flat cut-out cookies like <br>sugar cookies<br> and <br>gingerbread cookies<br> are the best candidates for decorating with icing. These cookies are sturdy enough that they won\u2019t crumble as you work with them and have large, flat areas that are just begging for a bit of decoration. <br> Make sure your cookies are completely cool before you start decorating or the icing will melt as you decorate. I usually find it easiest to make the cookies on one day and decorate them the next. Since the decorating itself is fairly time-consuming, I also sometimes set up a cookie-decorating station on my counter and decorate a handful of cookies at a time over the course of a day or two. ",

        "Recipe: Baked Spaghetti Squash Carbonara",
        "<br> How do you feel about spaghetti squash? Do you consider it a bad joke of a vegetable, promising carbs without remorse, but actually offering a bowl of slippery, slimy strings? Or do you love it for its teasing imitation of spaghetti, still holding its own with sweetness and a toothsome bite? <br> Actually \u2014 never mind. I don\u2019t really care how you feel about spaghetti squash. Because I know how <br>everyone<br> feels about spaghetti carbonara, and this baked spaghetti squash carbonara is going to warm your pasta-loving heart in exactly the same way. Except, with way fewer calories. And isn\u2019t that really the point of spaghetti squash, if we\u2019re all being honest? <br> A few years ago I wrote a big book on healthier casseroles, called <br>Not Your Mother\u2019s Casseroles<br> <br>(no canned cream of chicken soup, I promise). In the process of developing 225 recipes I scavenged about for every last way to pack vegetables into casseroles, and eventually lit upon spaghetti squash. I wrote a recipe that mixed up spaghetti squash, ricotta, and a few sprigs of sage, and banged it into the oven. I didn\u2019t have high hopes, to be honest, but its tender, rich, and creamy texture made it one of my favorite recipes in the book. <br> This casserole came to mind, suddenly, as I sat at a traffic light on the way to the grocery store, and I had a massive brainwave: spaghetti squash carbonara. Could I turn spaghetti squash into everyone\u2019s favorite eggy, porky, over-the-top delicious pasta dish? Just maybe. <br> I started by consulting a few authentic pasta carbonara recipes,<br> beginning with Sara Kate\u2019s<br>. True spaghetti carbonara has just a few simple ingredients: eggs, cured pork, fresh-grated Parmesan or Pecorino, and a hefty dose of black pepper. <br> I stuck closely to the classic elements, mixing eggs and Parmesan with spaghetti squash strings scraped out of the baked halves, but I also added a cooked onion and a dollop of ricotta to make up for the lack of richness in plain baked squash. <br> I baked it until crisp and golden on top, then dug in. It hit every note I look for in spaghetti carbonara: peppery, creamy, bits of rich bacon mixed in. And yet it didn\u2019t weigh me down in the same way. I have nothing against pasta \u2014 love the stuff \u2014 but this baked carbonara is a new favorite in the house. Even my pasta-desirous husband gobbled it up. It might not be pasta, but it\u2019s some serious carbonara. Spaghetti squash lovers (and haters), rejoice! ",

        "<br> Ever wonder what wassailing means? It\u2019s the medieval precursor to modern-day caroling, where the singers are offered a drink from the wassail bowl after they carol. Wassail itself is a hot mulled cider punch. Our version simmers apple cider and orange juice together with traditional mulling spices, fresh fruit, honey, and slices of spicy fresh ginger for a sangria-like twist on regular mulled apple cider. Spiking it with bourbon or whiskey is up to you, but this drink is worth pulling out the slow cooker for whether you\u2019re expecting carolers or holiday guests. <br> This modern wassail contains plenty of fresh winter fruit to sweet and tart flavors to the cider and juice. Add in a little pouch of whole cloves, allspice, and ginger; throw in a few cinnamon sticks; and let the slow cooker transform the juice into a hot punch that\u2019s warming on a frigid day. The best part is that the whole house is enveloped with its enticing scent. Since the spiking is optional, even little ones can sip away on this winter treat. ",

        "<br> As with any country, you can find traces of its history in its cuisine. Pork vindaloo, famed for its fiery heat, speaks directly to the Portuguese occupation of the southern Indian state of Goa. As Neela explains, \u201cCarne de vinha d\u2019alhos, a Portuguese dish made with pork, was the basis of the now-famous vindaloo served in Indian restaurants. Although many make it with lamb, chicken, or shrimp, I prefer the original recipe with pork, redolent of tamarind, vinegar, and black pepper.\u201d <br> Making this vindaloo at home gives you the opportunity to control the heat level of this dish. Even if you choose to lean towards a more fiery flavor, many of the elements of this recipe help it maintain a sense of balance, no matter the level of heat. <br> The browned onions and fennel in the tadka create an earthy-sweet backbone, and the sour tamarind pulp stirred in at the end creates a sharp heat that flickers in and out, rather than a flat bite that sits on your taste buds. The pork itself grows tender and melting under the long, low-and-steady heat of the slow cooker. <br> Break out the <br>raita <br>for this one! ",

        "<br> This vegan sweet potato chowder delivers everything you want in a warm fall soup. It has a velvety broth laced with seasonal spices, like sage and paprika, and chunks of tender root vegetables. It\u2019s delicious the day you make it, but like most soups, it\u2019s even better the next day. So make a big batch of this plant-based chowder and enjoy it all week long. <br> We\u2019re calling this soup a chowder, given the fact that potatoes are the key to both its velvety base and its hearty texture. And thanks to the silky-starchy contents of sweet potatoes, you\u2019ll get the creaminess expected in a chowder without a drop of cream. <br> After a quick simmer on the stovetop, a few cups of soup, both broth and vegetables, are whirled through the blender, then stirred back into the pot. Pur\u00e9e a little extra if you\u2019re after an even thicker soup, or less for a bowl that\u2019s more brothy. ",

        "How To Make Homemade Eggnog",
        "<br> Oh, eggnog \u2014 you devilish seasonal treat, you. We love you in our <br>morning lattes<br> and we love you spiked with bourbon before going to bed. You make the <br>most delicious French toast ever<br>, and even our favorite cake is <br>sending you love notes<br>. Is there anything you can\u2019t do? Truly? <br> This holiday season, I say let\u2019s skip the store-bought cartons and additive-laden jugs, and have our eggnog the old-fashioned way: with real eggs. This stuff is incredible, and it couldn\u2019t be easier to make. As long as you have eggs, sugar, milk, and cream in your fridge, you can have eggnog anytime the craving hits. Here\u2019s a step-by-step recipe to guide you to eggnog bliss. <br> Homemade eggnog is thickened first with egg yolks and then given even more texture by folding in whipped egg whites. Those egg whites transform what can be a fairly heavy, overly rich drink into something airier and frothier \u2014 though no less decadent. If you want to make it thicker or creamier, play with the proportion of whole milk and heavy cream, adding more cream for some extra body and richness. <br> As for shelf-life, if your household is anything like mine, leftover eggnog is rarely an issue. Depending on the amount of liquor you add, eggnog will also keep quite well for several days. <br> It\u2019s called eggnog because, classically, it contains eggs. And, classically, those eggs are raw. Classically, eggnog is also aged with liquor for several weeks (or months!), which sounds insane until you realize that the booze acts as both preservative and sterilizer. Very few bacteria, including <br>salmonella<br>, can survive in the presence of alcohol, as <br>has been proven<br> in lab experiments at Rockefeller University. <br> Think of it this way: Aged eggnog is another way of preserving seasonal bounty. Eggs and milk gathered at the height of their season \u2014 summertime \u2014 are preserved with alcohol until a time when they were historically scarce \u2014 wintertime. The fact that the resulting preserved beverage makes an addictively good boozy cocktail for holiday celebrations is a win for frugal homesteaders everywhere. <br> But even if you\u2019re not aging your eggnog like a Victorian, the same Rockefeller lab determined that the risk of food-borne illness is still <br>quite small<br>. I recommend using the freshest organic eggs you can find. You can also use pasteurized yolks and whites, or cook the eggnog base on the stovetop (see instructions at the end of the recipe below), if you need to be careful of using raw eggs. <br> Aging your eggnog for even a short time does wonders for its taste and texture. The distinct flavors of egg, cream, and liquor meld together even after just a day or two in the fridge, making a smoother, more balanced cup of nog. The proteins in the eggs also start to thicken, giving eggnog its signature spoon-coating thickness. <br> If you\u2019d like to try aging your booze for longer than a few days, I recommend using a ratio of two parts dairy to one part liquor \u2014 half the amount of liquor as milk and cream in the recipe. If this is a little too boozy for your taste, you can thin it out with some extra cream when you serve. ",

        "<br> I love orzo \u2014 its plump, chewy grains so much like rice, but on a grander scale and with the tenderness of pasta \u2014 but I don\u2019t cook with it often enough, which seems silly, given how fast it can be. So I mused over what I would really like to eat <br>right now<br> and came up with all the fall vegetable flavors. Onions, garlic, mushrooms, sweet potato \u2014 preferably dark and caramelized, built from the ground up in one big skillet, browning, caramelizing, and saut\u00e9eing until you\u2019re left with a big pile of chewy orzo and dark, delicious fall vegetables. <br> After the pasta is cooked, you only use one more big saut\u00e9 pan to put this dish together. It takes some hands-on time, but it\u2019s very satisfying, layering each component and flavor on top of the previous. You really see how flavor is built and where each taste in the dish comes from. <br> This is also a satisfying dish to eat. There\u2019s no meat, and it\u2019s even vegan if you leave off the final sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, but I would happily serve this to a crowd of dedicated meat-eaters; it\u2019s one of those dishes that really spans a group of various preferences. <br> A few technical notes on this dish: It\u2019s best to use your biggest stove burner and your biggest saut\u00e9 pan. I used a great big six-quart saut\u00e9 pan, although a four-quart should work as well. If you don\u2019t have a straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan, just use your widest, deepest skillet. ",

        "<br> There is no resisting rugelach, no matter how nubbly or imperfectly rolled. They\u2019re buttery, flaky, and just the right amount of sweet. You can fill them with anything from ground nuts and honey to peanut butter and chocolate \u2014 the only real constant is using cream cheese to make a super-tender dough. Here\u2019s how you can make them at home. <br> I am a student of the Dorie Greenspan School of Rugelach. This means that I make my rugelach dough in a food processor rather than with a mixer or by hand. This makes an incredibly tender dough where the cream cheese and butter are cut into the flour rather than absorbed by it. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, though, no worries \u2014 take a look at the instructions for making rugelach by hand at the end of the recipe. <br> I like adding an egg yolk to my dough. It\u2019s not strictly necessary, but I like it for the extra richness and a guaranteed golden color in the oven. These are, after all, celebration cookies, so now is not the time to shy away from a decadent cookie. <br> Also as part of the Dorie Greenspan School, I prefer rugelach rolled individually into crescents rather than rolling the dough around the filling and then slicing them into pinwheels. This <br>technique is a bit more labor-intensive<br>, but I find the crescent shape to have a more satisfying bite and pleasing appearance. <br> I love making several different fillings for the ruglach and using a different one with each batch. I always make a classic honey-walnut filling, and chocolate is another favorite. If I have a really good summer jam in the cupboard, I\u2019ll fill a batch with a few spoonfuls straight from the jar. I\u2019ve seen rugelach made with an amazing array of fillings, so you can really let your imagination go wild. <br> Like most classic recipes, there are lots of opinions about what constitutes a \u201ctrue\u201d rugelach. Do you have a favorite way of making them or a must-have filling? ",

        "<br> These graham cracker cookies possess the qualities of any desirable cookie: crispy around the edges, with a super-soft, chewy center. While you can certainly eat them on their own, they do their best work in pairs, with a sweet filling sandwiched in between, be it marshmallows and chocolate for a new take on the s\u2019more, <br>ice cream<br>, or fluffy <br>buttercream<br> frosting. <br> To give these cookies maximum graham flavor, I went right to the source \u2014 graham crackers. Instead of the flour used to create the foundation for most cookie doughs, I went out on a limb, grinding sheets of purchased graham crackers in the food processor until they reached a fine, sand-like texture. And you know what? It worked. Using \u201cgraham flour\u201d (a tactic I\u2019ll certainly be employing elsewhere) not only ups the honey and whole-wheat flavor, but also gives these cookies more of a textured crumb. ",

        "How To Make Creamed Corn in the Slow Cooker",
        "<br> Sweet corn is all well and good, of course, but sweet corn simmered with milk and butter? Well, that\u2019s another heaven entirely. <br> Here is a slow cooker version for this much-loved party side dish. Throw everything in the Crock-Pot for a few hours, then take it directly to the buffet table. You\u2019re a hero <br>and<br> you hardly had to do work at all. <br> Traditionally, creamed corn is simmered on the stovetop for anywhere from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, until every kernel of corn is plump with cream and coated with sauce. Yum. Doing this simmering step in the slow cooker frees up your stove and also gives the corn some extra time to soak in that buttery bath. <br> I also like that I can put the slow cooker on its \u201cwarm\u201d setting and keep the side dish nicely hot on a buffet table. Since the sauce tends to get thick and a bit gummy as it cools, this guarantees creamed corn perfection for the first person in line all the way to the last. <br> On the stovetop, the milk or cream used to cook the corn gets a chance to slowly reduce into a thickened sauce. In the slow cooker, with its closed environment (read: no evaporation) and the long cooking time, getting the sauce to thicken properly can be tricky. And so we bring in cream cheese for some extra help to make sure the sauce gets creamy and thick! <br> Cream cheese is more than just insurance for a creamy sauce, though \u2014 creamed corn made with cream cheese is, if possible, even more delicious. The sauce is thick and milky, and cream cheese adds a more rounded flavor to the whole dish. An unsuspecting guest might not ever guess that it\u2019s your secret ingredient, but they\u2019ll definitely ask you for the recipe. <br> This is a true \u201cdump it all in the slow cooker\u201d recipe. You can even use frozen corn, fresh sweet corn, or canned corn \u2014 whichever you have in your kitchen. If you\u2019re around while things are bubbling away, give the corn a stir sometime during the second half of cooking \u2014 this helps start to work the cream cheese into the mix and also prevents a crust from forming around the outer edge, but the dish will be fine without it. <br> One thing to note: The sauce might appear a bit thin and curdled when you stir it at the end of cooking. Just keep stirring until the sauce comes together, then let everything sit for a few minutes to give the sauce a chance to thicken. If it thickens up a little <br>too<br> much for your liking, stir in a little milk. ",

        "<br> With Dijon mustard, thinly sliced ham, and creamy Gruy\u00e8re, it seems the classic croque-monsieur was made for the casserole dish. If it\u2019s a brunch stunner you\u2019re after, or a dinner option with breakfast undertones, then this all-in-one baked take on the croque-monsieur should shoot to the top of your must-make list. <br> This dish can be assembled the day of, but it\u2019s actually best if everything up until the actual cooking is done the night before. This allows the flavors to meld and gives the bread time to sop up the milk and eggs. When baked, the bread takes on the custardy texture of French toast and creates a firm-but-creamy base for the casserole. <br> Because this dish is so rich, it\u2019s topped with arugula dressed with lemon and olive oil just before serving. The bitter, peppery bite of arugula and acidic sharpness of lemon cut right through the rich saltiness, adding a bit of bright vibrancy. <br> As with anything simple and delicious, many variations on this sandwich exist: Add a fried egg on top and you have the croque-madame. The croque-Proven\u00e7al sees the addition of tomatoes. Replace the ham with smoked salmon for croque-Norv\u00e9gien. The croque-madame is especially popular; the name supposedly comes from the egg on top resembling an old-fashioned lady\u2019s hat. Take a cue from evolving interpretations of this sandwich to customize this dish with ingredients of your choice. ",

        "<br> I have two schools of thought on pasta recipes: they should either be an event or they should take no time at all. When I want to make an event out of pasta, I\u2019ll make my own fresh pasta with a homemade sauce (and <br>homemade ricotta<br>, if I\u2019m making lasagna!). These recipes take all evening and are usually accompanied by a bottle of wine. <br> But for the other times, I just want a quick pasta dish I can get to the table without much fuss. That\u2019s where this orzo pasta with sweet winter squash and wilted spinach comes in. <br> Yes, I know roasting butternut squash isn\u2019t usually what you think of when you want a quick meal. Here\u2019s how you can get around that: Roast the squash (or several squashes!) on the weekend or whenever you have time, and then it\u2019s already prepped and ready to go for whatever dish you want it for \u2014 this pasta dish, a workday salad, or an easy rice bowl. Just rewarm it for a few minutes in the microwave, a low oven, or in the skillet along with whatever you\u2019re cooking. Of course, if you\u2019re in a real hurry, steaming the squash for roughly 10 minutes is the way to go. <br> In terms of pasta, I like to use orzo when I want the pasta to be the sidekick to whatever vegetable I\u2019m highlighting. Since it\u2019s fall, butternut squash and spinach are definitely both the colors and flavors I\u2019m craving. <br> This pasta dish also shows my other bias: I really enjoy winter squashes and sweet potatoes when paired with blue cheese. Plus, mixing the blue cheese in with the warm pasta and squash creates a creaminess in the dish without a heavy sauce. Of course, I understand that blue cheese isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite \u2014 goat cheese also works well for creating this creamy texture (but just isn\u2019t the same, flavor-wise!). ",

        "<br> Stuffed cabbage is a comforting winter dish that also makes a complete meal. The traditional preparation of a savory meat-and-rice filling rolled up in tender cabbage that\u2019s slow-baked in a sweet-sour tomato sauce is a labor of love. <br> To make this dish more weeknight-friendly, we make these on the stovetop in just one skillet, from start to finish. You can have all the same satisfaction in a fraction of the time. <br> Traditional stuffed cabbage is made by making a sweet-and-sour tomato sauce on the stovetop and then transferring the sauce into a baking dish with the stuffed cabbage. The whole thing is baked in the oven and usually takes close to an hour. To speed things up here, we make the sauce in a skillet, add the stuffed cabbage rolls right into the pan, and simmer it covered so it takes only about 35 minutes instead. <br> Savoy cabbage, with its sweet and tender leaves, wilts down with a quick blanch in boiling water and is ideal for stuffed cabbage. Get a large head to make sure the leaves are big enough for stuffing. You can use the remaining cabbage in a <br>stir-fry<br> or <br>slaw<br> later. <br> To make this even more weeknight-friendly, you can simmer the tomato sauce, mix the filling a day ahead, and store separately in the refrigerator. When you\u2019re ready to cook, just bring the tomato sauce back to a simmer and proceed with the recipe. ",

They\u2019re soft, tender, and just a little bit chewy, with a delicate exterior that\u2019s coated with a thick layer of powdered sugar. <br> Crinkle cookies get their well-deserved name from the way the cookie splits and cracks along the sugar-covered top and sides as it bakes. And while they look pretty, what makes these cookies stand out is their robust chocolate flavor. With one bite you\u2019ll discover a rich and indulgent flavor that\u2019s more reminiscent of a truffle than a cookie. <br> While most crinkle cookies get only a single coating of sugar, this recipe goes further. Before being rolled in powdered sugar, the cookie dough balls are first rolled in granulated sugar. The texture helps the powdered sugar better adhere to the dough, and it adds a delicate crisp bite that coats the whole cookie. ",

        "<br> Do you stir-fry at home? Is this easy, healthy method of cooking in your weeknight repertoire? It should be \u2014 a simple chicken stir-fry takes only a little work to prep and even less time at the stove. But perhaps stir-frying is intimidating to you. Do you wonder whether you need special equipment or a high-powered stove? We\u2019re here to tell you that <br>no<br>, you don\u2019t need anything special to stir-fry at home; it\u2019s one of the most home cook-friendly techniques. <br> Last week, we stepped into the New York City kitchen of Grace Young, stir-fry expert and author of multiple books on authentic Chinese cooking, including <br>Stir-Frying to the Sky\u2019s Edge<br>. Grace demonstrated for us (and you!) everything you need to know to make several favorite stir-fry dishes, starting with this delicious, easy chicken stir-fry. <br> What <br>is<br> stir-frying? \u201cIt\u2019s really more of a <br>tumble-<br>fry than a stir-fry,\u201d says Grace. A stir-fry is a simple dish of meat or vegetables (and often both) that is cooked quickly in a wok over high heat. <br> In a home kitchen, this cooking method does <br>not<br> involve any sort of frenzied flipping technique or high-flame pyrotechnics, regardless of what you may see in restaurants or on television. Good homemade stir-fries are actually not stirred constantly; they are carried out calmly and methodically by letting the food cook on the sides and bottom of a well-heated wok, then \u201ctumbling it over\u201d to help it finish cooking. <br> <br>Read more: <br>How To Buy & Season a Wok<br> <br> <br>The result of this method (and this recipe) is an incredibly aromatic, delicious chicken stir-fry with tender chicken that tastes of soy and garlic, and bright, fresh vegetables that haven\u2019t lost their snap. The ingredients and technique are simple, but together they make something wonderfully more than the sum of their parts. Master this method, and you\u2019ll be able to feed yourself (and others) on practically a moment\u2019s notice. <br> <br>Visit Grace\u2019s Website: <br>Grace Young.com<br> <br> <br>Learn More About Wok Cooking: <br>Join Wok Wednesdays<br>, a group of enthusiastic cooks working their way through Grace\u2019s book, <br>Stir-Frying to the Sky\u2019s Edge<br>.

I also think of this as breakfast casserole season; everyone is looking for easy, hearty ways to put breakfast on the table in the middle of the zaniness. Well, here you go: One of the simplest, heartiest breakfast casseroles I know how to make. <br> This is a simple, hearty dish of eggs baked with potatoes and vegetables, with a bit of bacon thrown in for flavor. This is easily adaptable for vegetarians, with extra vegetables and peppers standing in for the bacon. <br> It can also be made ahead: Just mix it all up and put it in the fridge overnight, then bake away in the morning. Leftovers are yummy too. ",

        "How To Make Vanilla Magic Cake",
        "<br> Magic cakes are a one-pan wonder for folks who love lots of different textures in their desserts. The top is crisped and golden-brown; airy as a gossamer angel food cake. The center is custardy, flan-like, and creamy. The bottom is a dense layer \u2014 not quite a cake and not quite a custard and altogether delicious. <br> With a few cartons of eggs, a few gallons of milk, and some pans, I started the journey to creating a magic cake recipe that works every time. After a few tests, how to make a vanilla magic cake became clear. There are five little technical tricks that will help make magic cake work. Follow them and watch the magic happen every time. <br> This might seem obvious, but in this recipe it\u2019s critical. The volume of ingredients in this recipe reliably bakes into a magic cake if you use an <br>8-inch-square pan that is two inches deep<br>. A pan that is too big will be too shallow for the custard to form. <br> The mixture of egg yolks, granulated sugar, and water needs to be whisked by hand, with a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, or with a handheld mixer until the the sugar is dissolved. The egg yolk-sugar-water mixture needs to be very fluffy, very foamy, and a very pale yellow \u2014 almost white \u2014 and will take about five minutes. You need this unusual base to do its job so the cake\u2019s top layers work. <br> This is critical to this recipe. The egg whites, whipped to stiff peaks, are <br>stirred<br> gently into the batter with plenty of small, fluffy, clumps left behind. You don\u2019t want the whipped egg white to dissolve completely or give the whole batter any sort of traditional leavening or even a lightening up. Different goals require different techniques, so set aside what you may know about folding in egg whites and give it a try. <br> Most cakes are baked at 350\u00b0F and a rare few at 325\u00b0F. This is one of the rare ones that is best baked at 325\u00b0F. The center is a custard and needs slow baking to cook into creamy yumminess. Make sure you have an oven thermometer to ensure you\u2019re baking this at the correct temp. <br> Magic cake is done baking when the sides are set, the center wobbles a little, and the top is a warm brown. You will not be able to use a traditional cake tester or the tip of a sharp knife, since it will always come out a bit wet. <br> Like a good custard or cheesecake, magic cake needs time to come to room temperature and time to sit in the refrigerator (covered lightly) to really turn out best. Refrigerate for at least four hours and up to 12 before serving. (It can be served at room temperature or slightly chilled.) It can even be stored in the refrigerator for a few days (again, covered lightly). Unlike most cakes, it will not get stale in the refrigerator. ",

        "How To Make the Lightest, Fluffiest Buttermilk Pancakes",
        "<br> With a million and one recipes out there, a pancake really has to be something special to make it stand out from the crowd. Friends, today I give you just such a pancake. A whole plate of them, actually. The lightest, fluffiest pancakes any of us here at Kitchn have ever had the pleasure of either making or eating. Every time I make them, I wonder why I ever bother making anything else. <br> Is that enough of a hook? I sure hope so, because these pancakes deserve to be made far and wide. Here\u2019s how you, too, can have a piping-hot plate of lofty buttermilk pancakes for your next breakfast. <br> When Dana Velden first shared her favorite recipe for <br>Lofty Buttermilk Pancakes<br> here on Kitchn in 2010, it immediately drew its fair share of both ardent supporters and dubious skeptics. What could possibly be so controversial? Two simple egg whites. <br> Rather than mixing the whole egg into the batter or even whipping the whites into lofty clouds before folding them in, Dana simply separates the egg, mixes the yolk into the batter, and then stirs in the egg whites \u2014 un-whipped \u2014 at the very end. <br> <br>Get the original recipe<br>: <br>Lofty Buttermilk Pancakes<br> <br> It doesn\u2019t seem like mixing egg whites into the batter would make any difference to the texture of the pancakes, but it does. We all had to try these pancakes for ourselves, and we were so impressed and smitten that these pancakes eventually made their way into our <br>Kitchn Cookbook<br>. Batch after batch, these pancakes deliver. They are always perfectly light and tender, delicately custard-like on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside; they are never heavy or dense, never dry or floury. <br> Separating the eggs might feel needlessly fussy for simple Saturday pancakes, but I feel that it\u2019s a worthy compromise for consistently fluffy pancakes over the recipes that require dragging out the mixer and beating the whites into stiff peaks. <br> Letting the batter rest for a few minutes before cooking the pancakes is almost as important as mixing in the egg whites on their own. This gives the flour in the batter time to absorb some liquid, which gives the pancakes a better texture. The baking powder also gets to work, making bubbles and lightening the batter even more. <br> The resting time also gives you time to warm up the pan. You want it warm enough so that your butter foams a little, but doesn\u2019t brown or start smoking. (Or if you\u2019re using oil, the oil should shimmer and glide over the surface of the pan.) <br> <br>More great pancake tips!<br> <br>5 Common Mistakes to Avoid When Making Pancakes<br> <br> The trouble with calling anything \u201cthe best\u201d is that not everyone will agree with you. I\u2019m OK with that! Even if you don\u2019t place these pancakes on the top tier of awesomeness like I do, I\u2019m still pretty confident you\u2019ll enjoy them topped with butter and maple syrup. <br> The perfect pancakes are light, fluffy, tender, and golden-brown, and this recipe does not disappoint. It even stands up to slight modifications, including substituting more buttermilk in place of the milk called for \u2014 in case you run out or just want one less measuring cup to wash. Buttermilk combined with the baking soda is a major part of what gives these pancakes their lift, plus we can\u2019t get enough of the subtle tang. <br> We\u2019ve also added a note of when to add blueberries. Not everyone wants a fruit-filled stack of pancakes, so rather than stirring a pint into the entire batter mixture (and inevitably turning it green from burst berries), we suggest you sprinkle them on top of individual pancakes just as they hit the pan, giving them time to sink into the batter before it is time to flip. The rest of the steps are streamlined so that you can get to the breakfast table faster. <br> \u2014 <br>Patty<br>, October 2017 ",

        "Recipe: Vegan Creamy Curried Cauliflower Soup",
        "<br> A simple pur\u00e9ed soup is something I turn to often. Lately, I\u2019ve been relying on a lightly spiced cauliflower soup to tide be over between the richness of the holidays. <br> The nice thing about this recipe is that it takes very little time to pull together. You simply cook down the onions and garlic with cauliflower, broth, and warm spices and ready your favorite toppings (I like crispy parsley, toasty cashews, and spicy red pepper flakes \u2014 all with a dash of olive oil). <br> You will likely buy a can of coconut milk (13.5 ounces), but this recipe only calls for one cup. I generally hate fussy recipes that leave you with odd leftovers, but I do find this to be the perfect amount of coconut milk to fold in toward the end. If you\u2019d like to add the whole can, it will still be delicious (just a bit thinner). What to do with your leftover coconut milk? I save mine to stir into warm oatmeal or muesli in the mornings. Or you can always freeze it for a future cooking project, too. <br> <br>Read more <br>17 Absolutely Delicious Ways to Cook with Coconut Milk<br> <br> Lastly, this recipe asks that you go easy on the salt during the preparation, but do feel free to season with additional salt and pepper once it\u2019s done cooking. Because sodium levels vary depending on what kind of broth you\u2019re using, I prefer to be conservative in the instructions, allowing you to adjust toward the end. <br> This hearty vegan soup gets a hefty dose of pungent spices and a thick, velvety texture from cauliflower and coconut milk. It makes a perfect light dinner with some warm pita bread, but it\u2019s also a great lunch the next day too. Be sure to taste as you go to find your ideal salt level. <br> \u2013 <br>Christine<br>, January 2016<br> ",

        "<br> When I was a child, there weren\u2019t a lot of sweets in our house, but come Christmastime, little teasing bits of my mom\u2019s holiday toffee would show up in my normally sugar-starved lunch bag during the week before school let out. Then, during our annual Christmas Eve tamale party, huge platters would appear, with piles of the stuff stacked high like poker chips <br> Though I moved across the country almost twenty years ago, she hasn\u2019t missed a single season of toffee. These days if Mom isn\u2019t visiting for the holidays she mails it to me, wrapped in little cellophane bags. If you can stand to share, a batch of skillet toffee makes a great gift for someone many zip codes away. <br> A cast-iron skillet helps get the sugar hot, but any skillet will do. A candy thermometer will help you hit the right temperature for the perfect hard-candy texture, though going by color \u2014 looking for a deep auburn hue \u2014 will also work. <br> <br>Makes about 2 1/4 pounds<br> <br> 1 pound unsalted butter<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 8 ounces good quality semi-sweet chocolate, chopped<br> 3/4 cup chopped toasted blanched almonds <br> Line the bottom and sides of a 10-inch x 15-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> <br> In a large cast iron skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. As the butter melts, stir in the sugar and salt. Continue stirring rapidly with a wooden spoon, keeping the sides of pan clean by brushing occasionally with a wet pastry brush. The mixture should bubble as you stir. Cook until the mixture turns a deep auburn brown and registers 300\u00b0F on a candy thermometer, taking care not to burn it. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. <br> Pour the mixture onto the lined baking sheet. Allow it to cool slightly, about 5 minutes, then sprinkle the mixture with the chocolate. When the chocolate looks glossy, spread it with an offset cake spatula or a wooden spatula, and sprinkle with the nuts. Gently press the nuts into the chocolate with the palms of your hands. <br> Cool completely (at least 6 hours) then break the toffee into chunks. ",

        "Recipe: Roasted Broccoli & Cheddar Soup",
        "<br> It might not be the prettiest, but this pur\u00e9ed soup more than makes up for its homely appearance with the deep flavors of roasted broccoli and extra-sharp cheddar cheese, and a creamy yet cream-free texture. Best of all, it all comes together in about 30 minutes, making it a quick and easy weeknight dinner option. <br> This soup was born on a hungry weeknight, when I was looking for a meal made with ingredients I almost always keep on hand. When cool-weather vegetables start dominating the farmers market, my crisper always holds bunches of dark-green broccoli and fat, sandy leeks. My husband\u2019s life-long devotion to extra-sharp white cheddar cheese means there is always a block in the cheese drawer. And there\u2019s always a potato lurking around the kitchen somewhere. <br> But the beauty of this soup \u2014 and of soup in general \u2014 is its flexibility. I\u2019ve made it with vegetable stock, chicken stock, and plain water. I\u2019ve skimped on the broccoli and used more potato. I\u2019ve started with onion or green garlic in place of the leek. And every rendition is good: creamy, bursting with broccoli, with a sharp edge of cheddar peeking out. <br> Roasting the broccoli adds a depth that plain boiled broccoli just doesn\u2019t have. If you are using a bunch of broccoli with stalks that are tender and sweet, chop up the excess stalks and roast them as well. If you love roasted broccoli as much as I do, it might be difficult to resist chowing down on the whole pan, but a bowl of this soup is a reward worth waiting for \u2014 especially since you won\u2019t have long to wait. <br> One of my husband\u2019s favorite soups happens to be broccoli-cheddar, but I rarely make it, as most recipes are decadent, cream-laced affairs that are better off saved for special occasions. This is the perfect lightened-up version \u2014 free of butter, heavy cream, and milk. Instead, the starch of a potato adds body, and a big handful of extra-sharp cheddar adds flavor and creaminess. <br> To make this soup not only wholesome but also easy, I\u2019ve added the option of using a bag of frozen broccoli instead of chopping up a head. I also upped the amount of broccoli used to ensure the soup wasn\u2019t too thin, which was a concern of some previous commenters.<br> \u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, December 2017<br> ",

        "Recipe: Make-Ahead \u201cHam and Cheese\u201d Breakfast Casserole",
        "<br> We\u2019re heading into prime brunch season, which means that <br>brunch casseroles <br>are about to enjoy their heyday. So I decided to revisit one of our most popular recipes <br>ever<br>, published several years ago, for a breakfast bake with bread, pancetta, Gruyere, and eggs. <br> I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll sound horribly hyperbolic if I talk about this recipe too long: It\u2019s rich, eggy, and unbelievably, incredibly delicious. This is one to memorize, folks, and to pull out for in-laws and overnight guests. It may just be the very best brunch casserole I\u2019ve ever made. <br> I ate a lot of breakfast casseroles growing up. Anytime there was a crowd to be fed before noon, this baked dish of egg, sausage, cheese, and day-old bread would appear. And yet, as an adult, I\u2019ve discovered that the classic breakfast casserole is a relative mystery to many of our friends. <br> The appeal is this: You throw everything in the dish the night before, allow the bread to soak up the egg-and-milk mixture overnight, and bake it in the morning. Breakfast casserole is perfect for a brunch party since you don\u2019t have to stand at the stove making individual omelettes or batches of pancakes. And it beats waiting outside in the cold at a crowded restaurant. <br> This recipe is an updated version of the gooey cheddar and sausage casseroles of my youth, and it was inspired by a fancy ham and cheese sandwich. We used pancetta and Gruy\u00e8re (although you could try an even more <br>sophisticated cheese<br>, with <br>challah bread<br> and caramelized onions for a touch of sweetness). Then we added nutmeg and thyme to brighten things up. <br> The best part about this make-ahead casserole? You get to sleep in (and even crawl back to bed while it bakes in the oven). <br> When I revisited this casserole, I did so with great anticipation. It\u2019s always received rave reviews and I was hungry to try it. I wasn\u2019t disappointed (and neither was my husband, who ate it the next morning with a glint of this-is-too-good-to-be-true delight in his eyes). This dish is outrageously good, with tender, eggy bread and savory cheese in every bite. <br> I\u2019ve made a lot of breakfast casseroles, but this is the first one to be layered in such a distinct way. Usually I jumble the bread, meat, and cheese all up together. This one is baked in layers, like a strata, with the bread on the bottom, then the pancetta, cheese, and herbs. This makes for a beautiful presentation and a very tasty dish; I liked how the layers looked as they were spooned out. <br> A couple notes: While the make-ahead aspect of this dish is very convenient, you don\u2019t <br>have<br> to make it ahead. You can also throw it together and bake it immediately. <br> Also, I did find that it needed a little more time to bake, especially since I used a deeper oven-safe bowl to bake it in. So that is reflected in changes to the instructions below. <br> <br>\u2013 <br>Faith<br>, October 2012<br> ",

        "<br> I\u2019ve been craving opposites lately. I want pasta, but I don\u2019t want it to be heavy. I want fresh flavors, but also something savory and comforting. I want vegetables, but I want a bit of meat, too. <br> Here, pan-roasted cauliflower and ribbons of prosciutto get folded into a bright but savory tomato sauce with pasta. It\u2019s a perfect union of all my conflicting opposites. <br> I am a fiend for smoky flavors, and this dish is full of them. The cauliflower becomes caramelized and blackened in the pan \u2014 almost to the point of becoming burnt. Don\u2019t fear the sear! <br> A second dose of smokiness comes from using fire-roasted tomatoes. If these seems a little too much for you, just use regular diced tomatoes instead. Or pick up a can of tomato pur\u00e9e and skip the step of pur\u00e9eing it yourself. <br> I wasn\u2019t originally planning on the basil, but I passed a display of fresh bunches at the store and I couldn\u2019t resist a little off-season treat. It ended up adding the perfect note of brightness to the dish. <br> If you\u2019re also in an opposites-attract mood, I think this dish will hit the spot. It makes enough to feed a crowd and comes together fairly quickly, so this would be a good choice if you\u2019re thinking of having friends over for dinner this week. Serve it with a crisp, vinegary salad and a bright white wine or IPA, and let yourself linger at the table until the bowls are licked clean. <br> This tomatoey pasta dish has comfort food written all over it. After retesting the recipe, I made a few adjustments to not only make it a little more wholesome but also make it extra easy to whip on a busy weeknight. I nixed the heavy cream originally called for in the recipe, as it was cozy enough without it, and I lowered the amount of prosciutto, using it as a crispy, salty garnish rather than stirring it in, uncooked, into the pasta, which previous commenters noted got lost in the dish. I also gave the option of using a bag of frozen cauliflower instead of chopping up a head for the sake of making things extra convenient. <br> \u2013 <br>Sheela<br>, December 2017<br> ",

        "How To Make Thanksgiving Leftovers Lasagna",
        "<br> When you\u2019ve had your fill of <br>turkey sandwiches<br> and <br>turkey soup<br>, but there are still leftovers waiting to be eaten in the fridge, choose greatness. And by greatness we mean a towering lasagna filled with layers of roasted Brussel sprouts, creamy sweet potatoes, Thanksgiving stuffing, and of course, the turkey. One<br> might<br> even argue that this next-day meal is even better than the main event itself. <br> How\u2019s that for a proclamation? But hear us out. Over time, the traditional Thanksgiving menu has evolved to include dishes that go well together. Or perhaps our palates have evolved to enjoy the food that\u2019s traditionally served together. It\u2019s your typical chicken or the egg scenario. <br> But even if you\u2019re the type of person who doesn\u2019t like their food touching on the plate, Thanksgiving is the exception. Cranberry sauce with that turkey? <br>Oh, yes.<br> A bite of mashed potatoes with a bit of green casserole? <br>Yes, please<br>. <br> Come Friday, we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to relive the glory of that meal all over again \u2014 just without the effort. With that in mind, we present this Thanksgiving leftover lasagna. Consider it an invitation to let your leftovers get a little handsy all in one dish. <br> This lasagna relies on Thanksgiving leftovers, but has flexibility on everything except the gravy and ricotta mixture. Here are some suggested filling substitutes for those included in the recipe below. <br> By replacing the classic noodles with no-boil noodles (sometimes labeled as oven-ready noodles), you can skip the boiling step required for traditional lasagna. Besides cooking up faster with less up-front work, the no-boil noodles also make lasagna make-ahead friendly. The noodles aren\u2019t cooked before storing or freezing, so they are less likely to get soggy while they wait to be baked. <br> No-boil lasagna noodles are dried sheets of pasta noodles that are rolled thinner than traditional dried lasagna noodles. These sheets are precooked and dried at the factory, making them faster-cooking in the oven. <br> While they were once considered as mere convenience food, many home cooks have made them a staple, as they not only cook faster and absorb moisture (and therefore flavor) when baked, but are also harder to overcook. <br> A successful leftover lasagna relies on two things: no-boil lasagna noodles, and the right amount of moisture. Because most of the lasagna components are already cooked, they won\u2019t have a ton of moisture to release as the lasagna bakes. In place of a red sauce or a b\u00e9chamel, we\u2019ll rely on gravy. The gravy provides moisture, but also a decent amount of starch to act as a glue between the leftovers and the lasagna noodles. <br> <br>Out of gravy? Make a quick batch:<br> <br>How To Make Gravy Without Turkey Drippings<br> <br> Stashing this leftover lasagna away in the freezer to eat in the future is a great option for when you <br>really just cannot<br> eat any more turkey. Consider building this lasagna in an aluminum baking pan to avoid freezing your favorite casserole dish. A thin foil will also ensure the lasagna freezes faster. Wrap it in plastic wrap, label, and date before freezing. Thaw this lasagna in the fridge overnight before baking. ",

        "How To Cook a Frozen Turkey",
        "<br> Yes, you really can cook a frozen turkey. Yes, it sounds completely improbable \u2014 even slightly alarming. But against all odds, yes, it works. If you find yourself staring down a turkey that\u2019s still frozen solid on Thanksgiving morning and you\u2019re wondering how in the world you\u2019re going to get dinner on the table in a few hours, there\u2019s hope. Here\u2019s how to go from frozen to golden without skipping a beat. <br> I have no tricks up my sleeve here; this method is as straightforward as they come. All we\u2019re doing is putting the frozen turkey on a roasting rack and throwing it in the oven at 325\u00b0F. From rock-solid frozen, your turkey will take about 50 percent longer to cook <br>than normal<br>. For instance, a 14-pound frozen turkey will take about 5 3/4 hours to cook \u2014 refer to the chart below for more estimated cooking times. You can also cook a partially thawed turkey; the estimated cooking times will be slightly less than for a frozen turkey. <br> The turkey cooks as it thaws. The wings and drumsticks will cook the fastest since they\u2019re relatively small and are on the outside of the turkey, while the big, thick muscle on the breast will take the longest. It also cooks from the outside in, so when you check the temperature during cooking, the meat close to the surface might be done cooking, while the meat closer to the bone will still be cool. Be sure to check the turkey\u2019s temperature at multiple places and at multiple depths; when everything is above 165\u00b0F, you\u2019re ready to eat. <br> You won\u2019t be able to do any fancy rubs, brines, or other days-in-advance prep to your turkey \u2014 you have to keep things pretty basic with a frozen turkey. Once the outside of the turkey is thawed, partway through cooking, you can brush it with butter (or another sauce!) and rub it with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like. <br> <br>Partially thawed turkeys will have shorter cooking times.<br> <br> Yes, cooking a turkey from frozen or partially frozen is totally safe and is even <br>USDA-approved<br>. Whenever we\u2019re thawing and cooking turkeys, our goal is to move it through the danger zone of 40\u00b0F to 140\u00b0F as quickly as possible. This is because, within this range, harmful bacteria and toxins can accumulate to harmful levels if the food is left for too long (longer than two hours). <br> When cooking a frozen turkey, no part of the turkey is within the temperature danger zone for longer than is safe, even though the total cooking time is longer. The heat of the oven keeps the outside toasty, and the meat cooks through as it thaws. When all parts of the turkey register 165\u00b0F, the turkey is ready. Be sure to double-check the temperature at multiple depths within the meat since the interior will be the last to thaw and cook through. <br> Oven-roasting is the only truly safe way to cook a frozen turkey. <br>Do NOT deep-fry or grill a frozen turkey. <br> <br> <br>Also, it\u2019s best to cook the stuffing separately. A stuffed turkey slows down the cooking process even further, and since the stuffing has to cook to 165\u00b0F as well as the meat, the turkey meat will overcook and become dry before the stuffing is ready. <br> Now, here is the million-dollar question: Sure, you can cook a frozen turkey, but is it anything you want to eat? Actually, yes! After cooking a few of these guys, I can verify that frozen turkey is really quite good. It might not be the best Thanksgiving turkey you\u2019ll ever eat, but for a last-minute Hail Mary that gets your holiday dinner on the table, I think you\u2019ll be mighty pleased. <br> With a regular, thawed turkey, the breast meat tends to cook the most quickly, and often becomes overcooked and dry while you wait for the thighs and drumsticks to catch up. This is reversed with a frozen turkey \u2014 the big, dense breast meat takes much longer to thaw and cook than the smaller thighs and drumsticks. Since the breast meat is the last to finish cooking, it actually stays quite moist. Even though the legs and thighs cook faster, the dark meat can handle a little extra cooking and still stay quite moist. <br> Don\u2019t be alarmed if the top inch or so of the breast meat hits 165\u00b0F and quickly shoots upward, even while the meat below it is still stubbornly below temperature. I found that the meat as a whole stayed surprisingly moist, even when technically overcooked. My suspicion is that the evaporating liquids from deep within the meat help keep the upper layers from drying completely out. <br> And if you find that your turkey does wind up a touch on the dry side, that\u2019s where gravy picks up the slack. <br> Do not try to remove the giblets before cooking \u2014 the turkey is just too solidly frozen. Partway through cooking, the turkey should have thawed enough that you\u2019ll be able to remove the giblets from the neck cavity. If your giblets, or the neck, are in the inside cavity of the turkey, it may take a little longer until they\u2019re thawed enough to remove. <br> If your giblets are wrapped in plastic, be very careful that the plastic doesn\u2019t get so hot that it starts to melt. Melted plastic does not make for tasty turkey on Thanksgiving. <br> You absolutely need to use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the turkey when using this method. The outside may seem totally done and the juices might even run clear, but the inner layers might still be frozen or under-temperature. Make sure you have a thermometer on hand, or send someone out to the store to get one. <br> I also highly recommend picking up a digital thermometer if you don\u2019t have one. These are much more accurate, easier to read, and take the temperature much more quickly than a regular meat thermometer. With this frozen turkey, I feel that being able to quickly and accurately read the temperature in multiple places around the turkey is important. <br> One bonus to this turkey-cooking method is that you can make a truly phenomenal gravy. The long cooking means all those drippings get really dark and caramelized, adding savory depth and richness to the finished gravy. If the pan starts looking dry or if the drippings seem to be starting to burn, just pour a cup of water or broth into the pan to simmer while the turkey cooks. <br> On the other hand, one downside to this method is that it ties up your oven for several hours right when you probably need it the most.
